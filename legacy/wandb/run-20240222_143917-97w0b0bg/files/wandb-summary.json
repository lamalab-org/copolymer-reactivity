{"prompt": "The content of the PDF are scientific papers about Copolymerization of Monomers. In each paper there \n                could be multiple different reaction with different pairs of monomers and same reactions with different \n                reaction conditions. From the PDF,extract the polymerization information from each polymerization \n                and report it in valid json format. Exclude comments out of the json output.
