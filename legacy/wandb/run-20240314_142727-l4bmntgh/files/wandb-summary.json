{"prompt": "The content of the PDF is a scientific paper about Copolymerization of Monomers. There are only \n                Copolymerization with 2 different monomers. If you find a polymerisation with just one or more than 2 \n                monomers ignore them. Its possible, that there is also the beginning of a new paper about polymers on \n                the PDF. Ignore these. In each paper there \n                could be multiple different reaction with different pairs of monomers and same reactions with different \n                reaction conditions. The reaction constants for the copolymerization with the monomer pair is the most \n                important information. Be careful with numbers and do not miss the decimal points.\n                If there are polymerization's without these constants, ignore these.
