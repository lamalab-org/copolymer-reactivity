solvents ff a metal with low ionization potential or hydrocarbons with considerable electron affinity be selected. The resultant complexes initiate polymerization of styrene in various media. Certain generalizations in the formation of metal-aromatic complexes in various media are discussed. In particular it has been noted that the deviation of alkali metal activity from the order Li ~ Na ~ K (Li is often more active than Na) may be explained by the increasing tendency of the cation towards solvation with decrease in its radius. 

## *Studies In Cyclic Polymerization And Copolymerization--Iv. Synthesis Of Some Divinyl- And Dilsopropenylacetal And Study Of Their Cyclic Polymerization

DIVINYLPROPIONAL, divinylisobutyral, 'divinylisoamylal, diisopropenylformal and diiso. propenylbutyral have been synthesized via dehydrochlorination of the corresponding fl, fl'-dichloroacetals. 

The capacity of these monomers to undergo cyclic polymerization has been investigated. Polymerization of divinylpropional, divinylisobutyral and divinylisoamylal in the presence of radical initiators has been shown to take place, similarly to the previously described divinylaeetals, by the cyclic mechanism with the formation of acetal derivatives of polyvinyl aleochols, i.e. polyvinylacetals. In contrast to nonsubstituted divinylacetals, diisopropenylformal and diisopropenylbutyral do not polymerize in the presence of initiators of radical polymerization. 

## Gamma-Ray Induced Copolymerization Of Acrylonitrile And Ethylene

V. F. Gromov, P. M. Khomikovskii and A. D. Abkin, Vysokomol. soedin. 3: 
No. 7, 1015-1019, 1961. THE ~,-ray induced copolymerization of ethylene and acrylonitrile in toluene at 20 ° has been investigated. It has been found that the rate of the process and the mean molecular weights of the polymers increase with the increasing acrylonitrile content. The eopolymers are enriched in aerylonitrile for all monomer ratios. The monomer reactivity ratios calculated from the copolymer compositions are rl(AN ) ~7 and r2= n0.

A COMPARATIVE study has been made of the polymerization of vinyl ethers of 4-chloro-, 
4-bromo, 2,4-diehloro and pentachlorophenols in the presence of the etherates of boron trifluoride. The effect of time and temperature of the reaction and of the amount of catalyst on the polymer yield has been ascertained. It has been found that in the series of the p-monosubstituted ethers the highest tendency towards cationic polymerization is manifested by the vinyl ether of 4-bromophenol and the least by the ether of 4-fluorophenol. Among the ehlorophenol ethers the tendency towards cationic polymerization falls with increase in the number of chlorine atoms. The polymers obtained in all the experiments were colourless solids of molecular weight *ca.* 1500 and melting temperature 60-80 °. It has
