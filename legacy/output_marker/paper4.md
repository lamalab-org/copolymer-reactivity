# Relative Reactivity Ratios For Two New 2-Chloro-1,3-Butadiene Systems

G. S. WICH and N. BRODOWAY, E. I .  du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., Elastomer Chemicals Department, Wilmington, Delaware 

## Synopsis

The relative reactivity ratios in free-radical, emulsion copolymerizations for the systems %chloro-l,3-butadiene/methyl isopropenyl ketone and %chlor~-l,3-buta&ene/ 
methacrylic acid were found to be 3.6 and 0.1 and 2.68 and 0.15, respectively. Consequently, copolymers are formed substantially richer in Z-chloro-1,3-butadiene units than the comonomer feed, have little alternation teadency, and do not form azeotropes. 

Distributions of monomer units in the copolymers are described. 

## Introduction

The high relative reactivity of 2-chloro-!,3-butadiene in free-radical copolymerization with other dienes or activated olefins has been reported in both oil phase and emulsion systems.lS2 This paper describes the measurement of the relative reactivity ratios of 2-chloro-l,&butadiene/methyl isopropenyl ketone and 2-chloro-1 ,&butadiene/methacrylic acid monomer mixtures. 

## Experimental Materials And Methods Monomers

The 2-chloro-l,&butadiene (chloroprene) was distilled from a *50%* mixture with xylene (b.p. 59OC., nz 1.4578) and stored under nitrogen below 
- 2OOC. without stabilization. The active oxygen content at reaction time was 10-20 ppm. The methyl isopropenyl ketone (MIPK) was freed from stabilizer and dimer by distillation. The fraction boiling at 29OC. (50 
mm. Hg) was collected and stored below -2OOC. 

Glacial methacrylic acid stabilized with 0.025% of p-methoxyphenol was employed without distillation. Analyses for carboxyl groups and unsaturation were made by titrating with standard solutions of base and bromine. 

## Apparatus

Polymerizations were carried out in four-necked round-bottomed flasks fitted with agitators, thermometers, nitrogen inlets, burets, and hydrometer holders. The conversions were followed by measuring the changes in specific gravities with hydrometers calibrated in thousandths of a point. 

## Polymerizations

All operations were carried out under nitrogen and the distilled water was purged with nitrogen before emulsification. Emulsion recipes employed are given in Table I. Since the methacrylate anion has been shown to be much less reactive in polymerization than the undissociated methacrylic acid, the emulsion system for copolymerization of methacrylic acid was maintained at a **p H**  of 2.5 or lower to keep the acid undissociated.

Polymerizations were initiated at 4OOC. by careful addition of a 5% 
solution of potassium persulfate. The internal temperature was maintained at 40 f 0.5OC. by external cooling. As soon as the specific gravity rose at least 0.003 point, the copolymerizations were arrested by pouring the entire emulsion into methanol containing a trace of a polymerization inhibitor such as phenothiazine. 

## Purification Of Analytical Samples

Copolymers of 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene and methyl isopropenyl ketone were purified by repeated extractions with acetone. Similar treatment of a polychloroprene control yielded a reference value of 39.4% chlorine. Copolymers of 2-chloro-1 ,3-butadikne and methacrylic acid were purified by double precipitation from tetrahydrofuran solutions, water being used as the nonsolvent. The copolymers were dried at room temperature in vacuo. 

## Discussion Of Results Determination Of Relative Reactivity Ratios

The usual assumptions have been employed concerning the kinetic chain length, the existence of a steady state, and the constancy of monomer feed composition at low con~ersion.~ Furthermore, the presence of mercaptan modifier was assumed not to affect the relative reactivities. 

Fineman and Ross' have derived the following expression which permits straightforward calculation of relative reactivity ratios r1 and r2 from copolymerization data: 
where fl denotes the mole fraction of unreacted monomer MI in the feed and F1 denotes the mole fraction of M1 monomer units in the increment of copolymer formed at the initial stage of copolymerization. 

Each value of fl was taken to be the mole fraction of 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene in the initial monomer feed mixture. Each value of Flwas obtained by analysis of the copolymer for chlorine. The copolymer composition data for emulsion-copolymerized 2-chloro-1 ,&butadiene and methyl isopropenyl ketone are given in Table **11.** These data employed in eq. (1) yielded the straight line plot in Figure 1. The slope of the line is 3.6 and represents rl (MI = **2-chloro-l,3-butadiene).** The intercept at the y axis gives r2 
(M2 = methylisopropenyl ketone) = 0.1. 

The corresponding copolymer composition data for the emulsion copolymerization of 2-chloro-l,3-butadiene and methacrylic acid are contained in

## Detailed Structure Of Copolymer Chains

In both cases the copolymers were formed relatively richer in 2-chlorol,&butadiene than the comonomer feed. This is a consequence of the preference of both 2-chloro-1 ,&butadiene radical (ml.) and methyl isopropenyl ketone or methacrylic acid radical (mz*) for 2-chloro-1 ,&butadiene 
(MI) monomer. The arrangements of the monomer units in the copolymers are also similar. Copolymerization azeotropes are unlikely since both and *r:,* are not greater than unity or less than unity. The alternation tendency is small since r1 and r2 are not simultaneously close to zero. 

&The distributions of the sequence lengths of 2-chloro-l,3-butadiene and methyl isopropenyl ketone or methacrylic acid units were calculated by known methods6 for copolymers prepared from equimolar monomer mixtures. These are shown in Tables IV and V.

Less than 1% of the methyl isopropenyl ketone sequences contain more than two monomer units, whereas over **60%** of the 2-chloro-l13-butadiene sequences contain more than two monomer units. Similarly, only 1.7% of the methacrylic acid sequences contain more than two monomer units, whereas 53% of the 2-chloro-1 ,&butadiene sequences contain more than two monomer units. Thus both copolymers are elastomers resembling in properties the homopolymer of 2-chloro-l,3-butadiene. 

Infrared spectra confirm that 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene units in the copolymers are present in all possible modes of addition, and that these structures are present in the same ratio as in the homopolymer prepared at the same temperature. 

## Comparison With Other 2-Chloro-1,3-Butadiene Copolymerizations

The relative reactivities obtained show the same high reactivity for 
2-chloro-1 ,&butadiene as do previously reported copolymerizations shown in Table VI. Alternation is reported only with the highly polar vinylidene cyanide. l1

The Q and e values **for** 2-chloro-l,S-butadiene, based on its copolymerization with butadiene,l are calculated to be **8.07** and 0.46, respectively. 

The reported Q and e values **for** methacrylic acid12 are 2.0 and **0.7,** respectively. Based on the copolymerization of vinylidene chloride and methyl isopropenyl ketone,12 the Q and e values for methyl isopropenyl ketone are 
1.95 and 1.23, respectively. Thus, the calculated relative reactivities for 
2-chloro-l,3-butadiene/methacrylic acid are 4.5 and 0.21, and for 2-chlorol13-butadiene/methyl isopropenyl ketone are 5.9 and 0.094, in f i r  agreement with the experimental values. 

The high Q value of 2-chloro-l,3-butadiene indicates the strong tendency of the monomer to add to radicals. The relatively neutral e value permits the radical to react with only small alternating tendencies with both electron-releasing and electron-attracting substituents in the comonomer.
