## Synopsis

Monomer reactivity ratios *for* the copolymerization of ethylene (M2) with n-butyl acrylate, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, and vinyl fluoride have been measured a t  **1000** atm. 

The respective values and the experimental temperatures are r1 = 11.9, r2 = 0.03, 
70°C.; rl = 3.6, r2 = 0.24, 90°C.; r1 = 1.08, r2 = 1.07, 90°C.; TI = 0.16, r2 = 4.39, 
160°C. Price Q and e values for ethylene calculated from these reactivity ratios, uncorrected for differences in reaction pressure, are **0.03** and **-0.43,** respectively. 

New Q and e values *(Qo* and *eo)* for these four comonomers were calculated on the basis of ethylene rather than styrene as the reference monomer. Assuming that the QO and 60 
values for ethylene are **1.0** and zero, respectively, the monomer's Qo and eo value are as follows: n-butyl acrylate, 33.3, + **1.02;** vinyl chloride, 4.2, + **0.37;** vinyl acetate, 0.93, **-0;** vinyl fluoride, 0.25, + **0.6.** These Qo and eo values give calculated reactivity ratios which are in reasonable agreement with experimental ones. Good agreement is also obtained when the *7-2* value for the vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymerization is compared with the directly determined rate constant ratio for the addition of an ethyl radical to ethylene and to vinyl acetate, respectively, calculated from previously published data. 

A study of this sort is prompted by a number of considerations. 

The .free-radical polymerization of ethylene has been studied by a number of workers at autogeneous as well as high Although the mechanism for the high pressure, oxygen-initiated reaction has not been precisely e~tablished,~ 
it appears that the conventional addition polymerization mechanism is applicable to this high pressure reaction when the usual free-radical initiators are used.5 In studying free-radical copolymerizations of ethylene at high pressures, therefore, one is justified in utilizing the scheme proposed by Mayo and Lewis6 for relating instantaneous comonomer composition to the instantaneously formed copolymer. 

The increasing industrial importance of ethylene copolymers, for instance, demands that accurately known monomer reactivity ratios be obtained. 

Also, from a theoretical point of view, such a study may be of aid in relating monomer structure to reactivity, since ethylene with its lack of substituent groups is the logical choice for the reference point of such a scheme. 

With these views in mind, a study was undertaken to determine the reactivity ratios involved when ethylene is copolymerized with n-butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, and vinyl fluoride under free-radical conditions at 1000 atm. pressure. 

## Experimental Monomer Purification And Polymerization Procedure

The experimental equipment and the basic experimental methods have been described previously.' Vinyl acetate and n-butyl acrylate (Union Carbide Chemicals Company) were purified by fractional distillation and center cuts retained for use. Vinyl fluoride (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company) was treated by passage through Linde **#5A** molecular sieves before use, and polymerization grade vinyl chloride (Union Carbide Chemicals Company) was used as obtained. Ethylene was treated for oxygen removal by passing through an activated copper column at 18OOC. The oxygen level was reduced to 10 ppm by this treatment. 

The liquid comonomers were weighed directly into the open autoclave. 

The autoclave was then sealed and thoroughly purged with high purity nitrogen (Linde Company) before the introduction of ethylene. The gaseous comonomers were admitted from small tared cylinders after the autoclave had been purged with high purity nitrogen. Pressure was maintained throughout the reaction by pumping the solvent, sulfur-free, toluene. 

Azobisisobutyronitrile (Westville Laboratories) was the catalyst used in the n-butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, and vinyl chloride copolymerizations; 
the vinyl fluoride copolymerization was catalyzed by di-tert-butyl peroxide 
(Wallace and Tiernan). In all cases, the polymerizations were carried to less than 10% conversion and in most cases, less than 5%. 

## Polymer Isolation And Analysis

The pure copolymers were isolated as previously described.' 
Copolymer analyses were carried out by the appropriate elemental analysis. 

Carbon and chlorine determinations were made in these laboratories, and fluorine analyses were performed by the Clark Microanalytical Laboratories. The reduced viscosities of all copolymers were **0.2** dl./g. or greater. 

## Results And Discussion

Figures 1 through 4 show the resulting monomer-polymer composition curves for the four copolymerizations studied. In Table I the reactivity ratios, calculated by the method of Fineman and ROSS,~ 
are given. 

From these data several interesting points are immediately apparent. 

The first is that even though four comonomers widely differing in reactivity were copolymerized with ethylene, three of them gave reactivity ratio products *(rpJ* equal to unity within experimental error and the product for the fourth, butyl acrylate, did not deviate widely from unity. This, of course, shows that these copolymerizations tend to be ideal and that truly random copolymers, with little alternating tendency, are obtained in ethylene copolymerizations. The implications arising from these phenomena are discussed below in the calculation of structure-reactivity parameters from these reactivity ratio data. 

Another interesting observation is the wide difference in reactivity of the two vinyl halides, ethylene lying almost midway between vinyl chloride and vinyl fluoride in double-bond reactivity. Although a difference in reactivity between vinyl chloride and vinyl fluoride is to be expected, that one is more and the other less reactive than ethylene is not easily explainable. A third point noticed from these data is that *rl-r2-1* for the ethyl-

## Q And E Values For Ethylene Based On Styrene (Q = 1.0, E = -0.8)

The calculation of Alfrey and Priceg Q and e values for ethylene from these data presents a problem, since it is known that reactivity ratios are affected by the application of high pressures.' It has been shown, however, that the methyl methacrylate/acrylonitrile and styrene/acrylonitrile copolymerizations tend simply to become more ideal (w-2 tends toward unity) as pressure is increased to 1000 atm., with the result that the e values of a comonomer pair tend toward each other with increasing pressure while the Q values are relatively unaffected.' 
The generality of this phenomenon has not been firmly established, but the possible utility of having even approximate Q and e values for ethylene would seem to justify the inclusion of these calculated values at this point. These are presented in Table 11.

The very low Q value for ethylene is certainly to be expected. This finding corresponds with the fact that the activation energy for the addition of an ethyl radical to ethylene is **8.6** kcal./mole,lz while the addition of an ethyl radical to styrene requires only 4.0 kcal./mole activation energy.13 

## Q And E Values Based On Ethylene As The Reference Monomer

It has been suggested that the double bond of ethylene would provide the most reasonable reference point for the *Q-e* scheme;'O however, no quantitative data on ethylene copolymerizations have been available heretofore. 

Indeed, it would seem that ethylene copolymerizations at high pressure might provide a most useful method for the determination of relative monomer reactivities, since the perturbing effects of alternation due to double-bond polarity differences in the comonomers are at a minimum here. 

It is of interest, therefore, to determine Q and e values for these comonomers using ethylene as the reference monomer. 

Since the e value of a vinyl monomer is related to the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing characteristics of the pendant group on the double bond, one may assume that the e value for ethylene is zero. Even though subsequent work may indicate that a slight shift in this e value is desired solely to augment the self-consistency of the scheme, the choice e = 0 for ethylene is advantageous and provides a reasonable starting value from which to work. When the Q value for ethylene is chosen to be equal to unity, then the equations relating reactivity ratios to Q and e values become 

= ( Q o ~   exp { - (edl2)  (1) 
r2 = ~ / ( Q o ) I  
(2) 
for ethylene as monomer 2, where the subscript zero denotes the ethylenebased *Q-e* values. 

One important advantage which is obtained with the use of this system instead of the styrene-based system is illustrated in eq. **(2).** Here it is seen that the Qo value for a monomer is a rate constant ratio requiring no adjustment due to differences in double-bond polarity as is required when styrene is used as the reference monomer. A comparison of Qo values is therefore a more straightforward measure of monomer reactivity than a comparison of Q values. 

It will also be noted that here the copolymerization ideality (the proximity of *rlr2* to unity) depends only on the eo value of the comonomer, and, since ethylene resides at the zero point of the e scale, a relatively large 
(positive or negative) eo value is required to remove *rlr2* very far from unity. 

The experimental *rlr2* values given in Table I bear this out, **rlr2** being close to unity for ethylene copolymerizations with vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, and vinyl fluoride; only with n-butyl acrylate, whose e value is highly

positive, does the reactivity ratio product vary much from ideality. The Qo and eo values are given in Table I11 and compared with Q and e values calculated on the styrene basis (& = 1.0, e = **-0.8)** where possible. 

In order to determine if these values are reasonable, reactivity ratios have been calculated for the various copolymerizations possible with the chosen comonomers and compared with experimental values. This comparison is given in Table IV. It will be noted that, although the calculated values refer to high pressure reactions, the degree of agreement is at least sufficient to show that Qo and eo values are reasonable.

It is of further interest to compare the results obtained here with those recently published by James and MacCallum13 on the rates of addition of ethyl radicals to various monomers. When a value of **1014** ~m.~/rnole-sec. 

is taken as the bimolecular rate constant for the recombination of ethyl radicals,lZ one obtains a value of *lc3* = 1.0 x lo' ~m.~/rnole-sec. for the reaction

is calculated to be 5.0 X **lo6** cm.3/mole-sec., also at 90°C. The ratio k& 
= 0.5. The directly comparable value *(TJ* for the analogous homoand cross-propagation reactions in the copolymerization of ethylene with vinyl acetate is **1.07.** This is quite reasonable agreement, considering the experimental pressure difference which would, if anything, make agreement even closer. 

## Conclusions

The high pressure copolymerization of ethylene with n-butyl acrylate, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, and vinyl fluoride give monomer reactivity ratios from which Q and e values may be calculated on the basis of ethylene as the reference monomer (Q = 1.0, e = 0). These new *&-e* values form an internally consistent scheme judging from calculated reactivity ratios. 

Although high reaction pressures have to be used in order to obtain a wide range of copolymer compositions, this practical disadvantage may be off set by the fact that a better reference standard becomes available. The close agreement of the r2 value for the vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymerization with the directly determined rate constant ratio *(k4/k3)* indicates that data obtained by either method may be useful in attempts to relate monomer structure with reactivity. 

The authors wish to acknowledge the assistance of Mr. Ray Haas and Mr. Don Watts in carrying out many of the experiments.
