## Synopsis

The behavior of ethylene in copolymerization with methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate, diethyl fumarate, and diethyl maleate was investigated, and reactivity ratios for theae systems reported. 

Significant deviationa of all systems investigated, except ethylene-vinyl acetate, from the conventional copolymerization equation are noted and interpreted on the basis of subdtantial penultimate and penpenultimate effects. The consistency of the reactivity ratios developed in the systems ethylenemethyl acrylate and ethylenemethyl methacrylate with reported values **for** methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate is shown by application of the relationship *P.bPbP,* = 
PaoPcbPba. 

The copolymerization of ethylene with various monomers, polar and nonpolar, by free radical catalysis has been previously reported.'V2 Mortimer and co-workers investigated the copolymerization of ethylene *(MI)* and propylene *(M2),* analyzed the products by a C14 tracer technique, and reported reactivity ratios r1 = 3.30 f **0.15** and r2 = 3.1 f 1.7. An rlr? 

product of **10.2** was obtained. 

These results create new questions about the physical nature of ethylene copolymerization as compared with most other free radical copolymerizations. The prospect of block-type copolymerizations (preferred addition of either radical to its own monomer arising from *rlr2* > 1) is difficult to explain in the light of present knowledge of the nature of free radical copolymerization in homogeneous phase. In addition, ethylene monomer possesses a "duality" in copolymerization not shared by any other monomer. Either end may add equally well to growing radicals, which could lead to higher effective concentrations in copolymerization. 

Zutty and Burkhart2 reported copolymerizations of ethylene with nbutyl acrylate, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, and vinyl fluoride at **1000** atm. 

Their studies showed, on the contrary, reactivity ratio products *(rlr2)* equal to unity within experimental error for the last three systems and equal to 
0.36 f **0.12** for ethylene*-butyl acrylate. The last result would indicate an appreciable alternating tendency in this system, but for the fact that r1 (ethylene = *M1)* = **0.03.** Such a low value cannot be determined with great precision, so the most that can be concluded is that some tendency

toward alternation exists. Unfortunately, no compositions were report,ed containing more than 55 wt.-% ethylene, so no firm conclusions ambout rl = **Kaaa/Kaab** can be drawn. A similar difficulty in assessing rI = K"""/ 
Kaab for the system ethylene (M1)-vinyl chloride *(M,)* exists, since no compositions containing more than 40 wt.-% ethylene were reported. Their conclusions about ethylene-vinyl acetate do not suffer from this limitation. 

However, data at low vinyl fluoride contents in the system eth.vlene (Mi)- 
vinyl fluoride *(Mz)* raise substantial doubts about the reported r1 value 
(4.39 f **0.77)** and suggest possibly large differences among Kaaaa/Kaaab, Kbaaa/Kbaab, and KbaalKbab. 

In our study, ethylene has been copolymerized with vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, diethyl maleate, and diethyl fumarate at 
150Â°C. and pressures of **12,000** psi (Table I). 

The calculated reactivity ratios for the best fit of the conventional copolymer composition equation are given in Table 11. *

  a The value for r2 in this system raises questions because of the experimental difficul-

ties of producing copolymer at high levels of diethyl maleate. 
VAc-diethyl maleate would suggest that this r2 value may be lower. 
ating temperatures, however, would tend to increase r2. 

The fitting of data to the conventional equation unfortunately leads to a theoretical curve in the case of ethylene-methyl aerylate which is substantially divergent from experimental points (Fig. 1) particularly at high ethylene proportions in the charge. By employing Barb's equation,[4] where penultimate effects can be assessed :

$$n\ -\ 1\ =\ r_{1}{}^{\prime}\ x\ (r_{1}x\ +\ 1)/(r_{1}{}^{\prime}\ x\ +\ 1)\tag{1}$$
where x = *A / B*  the ratio of monomers in the charge, n = *a/b* the ratio of monomers in the copolymer, and 

$=\;K^{\text{baa}}/K^{\text{bab}}$.

would be possible if addition of **methyl** acrylate to inethyl acrylate free radical were unimportant at higher ethylene concentrations. However, since r2 = **11,** the more precise equation4 is required. 

devised by Dr. R. H. Hughes. 

* The copolymer compositions were determined by calibrated infrared techniques 

$$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{[r^{\prime}\ x\ (r_{1}\ x+1)/(r_{1}^{\prime}\ x+1)]+1}{(r_{2}/x)+1}\tag{2}$$
It was found that the latter equation fitted the data well with r1 = 0.30, rl' = **0.15,** andr:! = 11. 

The importance of the contribution to composition of additions of methyl acrylate monomer to methyl acrylate radical at various ethylene-methyl acrylate ratios is shown in the comparison given in Table 111.

A comparison of predictions of the conventional copolymer equation

It is of interest that, whereas (for r1 = 0.30, q' = 0.15, rz = 11) *rlr2* = 
3.3, *rl'r:!* = 1.65. The latter result indicates a tendency toward random addition in copolymerization at other than high ethylene proportions. 

Our conclusions about **rl'(Kbaa/Kbah)** suffer **from** lack of data in the intermediate range.

A related, but rather different situation exists in the system ethylenemethyl methacrylate (Fig. **2).** The best fit of the data with the conventional copolymer equation leads to rl = **0.2** and r2 = **17.** A remarkable rlrz = **3.4** results. Such values do not give proper weight to low methyl methacrylate contents in copolymers in the intermediate regions. 

Thus, a mole fraction of **0.721** methyl methacrylate in the copolymer is predicted at 0.185 mole fraction in the monomer whereas only **0.648** is actually obtained. 

A better fit of the available data (Table I) is obtained with eq. **(2)** where 

$$\begin{array}{r l}{{}}&{{}=K^{\mathrm{aaa}}/K^{\mathrm{abb}}\,=\,0.2}\\ {r_{1}{}^{\prime}\,=\,K^{\mathrm{baa}}/K^{\mathrm{bab}}\,=\,1.0}\\ {r_{2}\,=\,K^{\mathrm{bb}}/K^{\mathrm{ba}}\,=\,17}\end{array}$$
It is apparent from Table V that the reactivity of methyl methacrylate for an ethylene free radical is considerably reduced if the penultimate unit

in the growing chain is methyl methacrylate. In the region where this effect is apparent, it is difJicult to attribute the phenomenon to phase change effects. Much more feasible is the likelihood that polar and steric effects arising from penultimate methyl methacrylate units in the chain are much more readily transmitted across the terminal ethylene radical resulting in repulsion of adding methyl methacrylate monomer. Ethylene, as the smallest vinyl monomer and "chain unit component," exerts little shielding between penultimate methyl methacrylate unit and adding methacrylate monomer. On the other hand, it is doubtful that the addition of ethylene monomer to ethylene radical is influenced appreciably by whether the penultimate unit is ethylene or methyl methacrylate (except as this relates to "duality effects" involving ethylene monomer concentration). The consequence is that there is approximately **80%** reduction in the reactivity of methyl methacrylate for an ethylene radical if t,he penultimate unit is methyl methacrylate rather than ethylene. This finding is of particular interest since methyl methacrylate does not contribute penultimate effects in most copolymerizations because of shielding effects of the other monomers involved, which, of course, have substituents not shared by ethylene. 

Whether similar effects exist in the copolymerization of ethylene and methyl acrylate cannot be now ascertained because of the paucity of data in the intermediate region. It is probable that such effects are smaller 
(because of the greater configurational flexibility of methyl acrylate as a chain component). 

It is interesting to examine the ternary system methyl methacrylatemethyl acrylate-ethylene and the three binary copolymer reaction_conditions which comprise it in the light of a new theory advanced by Ham.5 This theory states that for systems of three monomers the following relationship holds : 
where 6 is a constant. It follows that Where the system is comprised of two conjugated monomers and one unconjugated monomer, experience has shown that 6 = **0.006.** Thus, to examine the system methyl methacrylate (MI)-methyl acrylate (MJ- 
ethylene (M3) *six* reactivity ratios: r12, rZl, *rI3,* r3], *rZ3,* and *r32* are required to check the theory, or four ratios to predict the reactivity ratios for an untried reaction_conditions. Thus, if r12, rzl, *rz3,* and *r32* are known, *rI3* and *r3]* can be predicted. For trial are chosen the values 

$ r_{12}$ = 2.3 (Ref. 6)

$ \ \ \ \ r_{23}$ = 11

$ r_{21}$ = 0.47 (Ref. 6)

$ \ \ \ \ r_{32}$ = 0.2
From PabPboPoa = **0.006** and rlz~23r31 
= ~ 1 3 ~ 3 2 ~ 2 1  
it is determined that rI3 
(calcd.) = **16.4,** rI1(ca1cd.) = **0.061;** r13(exptl.) = **17,** ral(exptl.) = 0.2. 

The agreement with prediction for the copolymer system methyl methacrylate-ethylene is quite good, particularly when considered in the light of the "duality" of ethylene monomer. The high **rlr2** product **(3.4)** creates difficulties in generalization. If one accepts rl and **0.1** and r2 = 17 (rlr2 
product = 1.7)

Here again there is evidence that a penultimate **(or** penpenultimate) diethyl fumarate in a growing chain ending in an ethylene radical actively repels adding diethyl fumarate monomer. 

Our conclusions about the copolymerization of ethylene and vinyl acetate are in agreement with those of Zutty and Burkhart2 *(rl* = 1.01, rz = 1). 

Copolymerization of ethylene and diethyl maleate yielded r1 = 0.25, r2 
= **10.** Although our experiments were conducted at a relatively high temperature (150Â°C.) rp is unusually high for a dietliyl maleate copolymerization. 

It is believed that the above conclusions are valid and proceed directly from the available data. However, an adequate means of assessing the 
"duality" of ethylene monomer in copolymerization will be required before a full understanding of ethylene copolymerization is possible. 

## Experimental Equipment

The equipment used in carrying out the copolymerizations is illustrated in Figure 4. It consisted primarily of a 250-ml. Magna Dash autoclave, an injection pot, pump, strain gage, pressure recorder, temperature recorder, vent assembly, earphones, and cold trap assembly. The term Magna Dash refers to the type of agitation obtained from a small dasher moving vertically up and down in the autoclave by a magnet cycling on and off exit the top section of the autoclave head. The autoclave internal temperature was recorded on a strip chart and regulated by steam pressure. A Baldwin- 
Lima 30,000 psi (max) strain cell was used. The pressure was recorded on an 8-hr. circular chart. The earphones were used to monitor the dasher action. 

## Procedure

The reaction was terminated by venting into a large cylinder. 

The stainless steel autoclave was solvent-cleaned, air-dried, and placed within the heating element. It was then sealed, purged twice with 2,000 
psig ethylene, and pressured to 4,000 psig. The desired internal temperature of 150Â°C. was obtained. The autoclave was then pressured to 8,000 
psig. The valve on the autoclave side of the injection pot was closed and the comonomer and catalyst placed in the injection pot. The additives were then swept into the reaction vessel while raising pressure to the desired value, which in all instances was 12,000 psig. The external heating was kept constant and the reaction allowed to proceed for 30 min. During the 
30 min. period the reaction vessel was isolated from the ethylene source and the pressure drop recorded. 

The gas from the cylinder was passed through a cold trap for isolation of entrained liquids. Following each reaction elaborate procedures were followed in cleaning the reactor and dasher mechanism. 

The copolymerizations were carried out at a temperature (15OoC.), pressure (12,000 psig), and catalyst concentration (2.7 X 
moles of ditert-butyl peroxide) which, **for** the homopolymerization of ethylene, resulted in a conversion of 6%. In the case of the copolymers the comonomers reached a higher conversion. The average total conversion, for example, of the methyl methacrylate runs, was about 7%. For methyl acrylate the average total conversion was about 13%.
