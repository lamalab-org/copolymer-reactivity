  \ reported for the preparation of 2-Vinylpyridine-Methacrylic Acid copolymers. The\
  \ document does not provide specific details about solvent used during the polymerization\
  \ process, the polymers' source (DOI or URL), or the specific method used for determination\
  \ of reactivity ratios; hence, those fields are marked as \"NA\". The polymerization\
  \ occurred under nitrogen at 70°C using a bulk method, with reactivity ratios reported\
  \ for both monomers."
