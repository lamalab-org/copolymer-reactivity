  Specific information regarding polymerization temperatures, reaction constants,\
  \ solvents and catalysts are provided, but not all the requested detailed information\
  \ such as polymerization types, methods, and determination methods for r-values\
  \ could be extracted precisely given the nature of the document【7†source】【11†source】【15†source】.\
  \ For reaction specifics such as exact temperatures and reaction constants, the\
  \ document reports variations and provides ranges or indications rather than fixed\
  \ values for each combination, making it challenging to pinpoint a singular set\
  \ of conditions for each polymerization reaction. The document primarily focuses\
  \ on the copolymerization of ethylene with n-butyl acrylate, vinyl chloride, vinyl\
  \ acetate, and vinyl fluoride under high-pressure conditions, with toluene being\
  \ mentioned as the solvent used."
