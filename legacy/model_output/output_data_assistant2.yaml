  \ for all polymerizations, exact confidence intervals (where not explicitly mentioned),\
  \ and the source DOI, could not be fulfilled directly and were listed as \"Varies\"\
  \ or \"NA\" when information was not accessible. The document provided some information\
  \ on solvents, monomers involved, and conditions for polymerization. However, the\
  \ detailed specifics of each reaction constant along with their confidence intervals\
  \ were not fully detailed or were omitted due to the incompleteness of the content\
  \ in the document display or the analysis thereof."
