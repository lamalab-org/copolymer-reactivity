  \ response includes identified monomers, the solvent used, temperatures for the\
  \ polymerizations, and the reaction constants where available, along with their\
  \ confidence intervals. The polymerization type is determined as bulk copolymerization\
  \ based on the context, though the exact polymerization reaction type (e.g., free\
  \ radical) was not directly specified in the extracted portions. The source URL\
  \ or DOI is not available in the quoted sections, thus listed as \"NA\"."
