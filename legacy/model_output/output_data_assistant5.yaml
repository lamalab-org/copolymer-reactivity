"Based on the extracted information, the polymerization conditions for the copolymerization\
  \ of ethylene and vinyl acetate can be summarized as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"\
  reactions\": [\n    {\n      \"monomers\": [\"Ethylene\", \"Vinyl Acetate\"],\n\
  \      \"combinations\": [\n        {\n          \"polymerization_type\": \"radical\
  \ copolymerization\",\n          \"solvent\": \"tert-butyl alcohol\",\n        \
  \  \"method\": \"NA\",\n          \"temperature\": \"62\",\n          \"temperature_unit\"\
  : \"Â°C\",\n          \"reaction_constants\": [\n            {\n              \"\

  \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that information such as the reaction method\
  \ (beyond specifying it was a radical copolymerization, which I deduced based on\
  \ the context), detailed confidence intervals for the reaction constants, and explicit\
  \ details about the pressure (other than it was conducted at pressures up to 40\
  \ kgf/cm2) were not provided or specified explicitly within the segments extracted.\
  \ Therefore, the 'NA' value is used where specific information was not available\
  \ in the described context."
