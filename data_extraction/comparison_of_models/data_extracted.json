        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A large number of the already published data of the experimental rate constants of propagation as a function of the monomer composition for copolymerization systems has been analyzed by applying a linearization procedure (introduced in the preceding publication) and new linear least square methods in order to obtain the radical reactivity ratios <jats:italic>s</jats:italic>. The compilation of data comprises the originally published parameter sets and those determined by the alternative methods. Besides the determination of the <jats:italic>s</jats:italic> parameters, the linearization plots also offer the possibility to rate the error of data sets as either non\u2010correlated or systematic. Simulations taking into account a random scatter in the experimental values give more insight into the accuracy of data. The limited applicability of the simplifying assumptions introduced by Fukuda et al. is confirmed. Correlations between the monomer and radical reactivity ratios, respectively, and the homopropagation rate constants are investigated. A systematic procedure for rating radical reactivity ratios based on the linearization procedure is proposed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Vinyl acetate (VAc)\u2013butyl acrylate (BuA) comonomer mixtures with various composition were polymerized by batch and semicontinuous emulsion polymerization processes. PVAc and PBuA homopolymer latexes as well as the (VAc\u2010BuA) copolymer latexes were characterized with respect to particle size, molecular weight, acid end groups on particle surfaces, and colloidal stability against electrolytes. The surface and colloidal properties of these latexes were also compared before and after aging and acid hydrolysis. The average particle size of batch latexes was independent of copolymer composition, whereas for semicontinuous latexes it decreased with increasing BuA content and was always lower than that of the corresponding batch latex. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) for batch latexes was narrower and much less dependent on composition than that of the semicontinuous latexes; bimodal MWD was found in most semicontinuous latexes with a substantial amount of low MW fraction. The total weak and strong acid end groups on particle surfaces for semicontinuous latexes is higher, and more dependent on composition, than the batch latexes. Acid\u2010induced hydrolysis results in a drastic change in the type and concentration of the surface groups of the semicontinuous latex particles. Colloidal stability against electrolytes showed that both electrostatic (due to surface acid groups) and steric [due to surface poly(vinyl alcohol)] mechanisms are contributing. However, for semicontinuous latexes, increasing PVAc content above 50 mol % resulted in a proportional increase and ultimately dominant role of steric stabilization. The results were interpreted in terms of differences in reactivity ratios and water solubilities of the two monomers and their effects on the locus of initiation and growth in the two polymerization processes, as well as the monomer sequence within the polymer chain and degree of homogeniety of the copolymer composition within the particle.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios of charged monomers depend on the pH of the medium, acrylic acid is the more reactive monomer below pH 3 and acrylamide above pH 4. The working pH was set at 3.6, a candidate for the crossover point, where no composition drift is expected. Copolymerization kinetics is investigated at this pH at various ionic strengths and a reaction without composition drift up to 80% conversion was achieved. All the chains produced in this reaction contain 30% \u00b1 3% acrylic acid. Copolymer conversions, molecular weights, and composition distributions were measured through Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization (ACOMP) system. The copolymerization data were analyzed by a recent error in variables method (EVM) and reactivity ratios are calculated. The results show that in salt free conditions, the reactivity ratios depend on the ionic monomer concentration (ionic strength) in addition to the pH of the reaction medium. The effect of polyelectrolytic interactions on the reactivity ratios and the resulting composition drift during the reaction, sequence length distribution, and Stockmayer bivariate distribution are discussed in detail. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Copolymers of isobutyl methacrylate (i\u2010BMA), and lauryl methacrylate (LMA) were prepared by free radical bulk copolymerization at 70\u2009\u00b0C using 2,2\u2032\u2013azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator.

The estimation process was performed by applying nonlinear techniques based on Marquardt optimization, \u201cordinary least square\u201d (OLS) and \u201cgeneralized least square\u201d (GLS) approaches and the results were compared with each other. The novel GLS estimator program developed during this study was employed to ascertain the shape of the copolymer composition curve and good agreement between experimental and calculated copolymer composition was obtained. Also, both real and simulated data was presented, which show GLS method is a statistically valid technique for estimating reactivity ratios by accounting response error structure. This new estimation method handles regression models with error terms that are heteroskedastic or serially correlated, or both.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>95% joint confidence interval for reactivity ratios from \u201cNLLS\u201d analysis.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>95% joint confidence interval for reactivity ratios from \u201cNLLS\u201d analysis.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

This was achieved by using azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator and dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent. Effects of copolymerization systems on monomer apparent reactivity ratios for acrylonitrile/ammonium itaconate copolymers were studied. The values of monomer apparent reactivity ratios were calculated by Kelen\u2010Tudos method. The apparent reactivity ratios in the aqueous suspension polymerization system are similar to those in the solution polymerization system at polymerization conversions of less than 18% [reactivity ratio of acrylonitrile (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>AN</jats:sub>) = 0.47 \u00b1 0.01, reactivity ratio of ammonium itaconate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>AIA</jats:sub>) = 3.08 \u00b1 0.01].

In water\u2010rich reaction medium [(H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) &gt; 80/20)], the monomer apparent reactivity ratios are approximately equivalent to those in the aqueous suspension polymerization system. In DMSO\u2010rich reaction medium (DMSO/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O &gt; 80/20), the apparent reactivity ratios are similar to those in the solution polymerization system. With an increase in the polarity of the solvent, the values of apparent reaction ratios both decrease. The values of apparent reaction ratios gradually tend to 1 with increasing the copolymerization temperature. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 103: 3920\u20133923, 2007</jats:p>",

It is found that MEA incorporation into the copolymer is increased in butanol, methanol (MeOH), and MeOH/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O solutions relative to the bulk system. Copolymer composition can be represented for solvent levels \u226550\u2009vol.% by a single pair of reactivity ratios (\u00a0=\u00a02.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16, =\u20090.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02) that differ from those in bulk (\u00a0=\u00a03.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44, =\u20090.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04). MeOH as solvent slightly reduces the propagation rate coefficient  of HEMA compared to the bulk system, in contrast to the increase in the MEA  value. Thus, the value of  is higher in MeOH for MEA\u2010rich systems compared to bulk, with the effect of the solvent reduced as the HEMA content in the comonomer mixture is increased. Adding water as cosolvent significantly increases  values for both monomers, with  in MeOH/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O higher than bulk values over the complete composition range. Furthermore,  for 50% monomer in the solvent systems studied can be represented by the implicit penultimate unit model using a single pair of radical reactivity ratios. It is concluded that the strongest influence of hydrogen\u2010bonding solvents compared to bulk is on the homopropagation  values, rather than on copolymerization parameters, and that the difference in relative reactivity of non\u2010functional and functional monomers in bulk and aqueous solution should be accounted for when studying emulsion copolymerization.</jats:p>",

Several of these radical copolymerizations were not successful in contrast to that of CTFE with <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI, although <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI monomer does not homopolymerize under radical initiation. The resulting poly(CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI) copolymers were characterized by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>19</jats:sup>F nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and their compositions assessed by elemental analysis. The reactivity ratios of both comonomers were determined by linearization methods of Fineman\u2010Ross, Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u00f6s for low conversions of monomers, and by the extended Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u00f6s method for high monomer conversions. The average values of the monomer reactivity ratios, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>CTFE</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub>, were 0.076 and 0.034 at 130 \u00b0C, respectively, depending on these monomer conversions and the applied methods of calculation. In all cases, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>CTFE</jats:sub> \u00d7 <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> product was close to zero, which indicates that poly(CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI) copolymers exhibit a high tendency toward alternation. This was also confirmed by the Igarashi's theory which revealed a high content of CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010MTI heterodyads. The <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> values for <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI monomer were also assessed (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> = 0.007 and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> = 0.99).

The synthesized copolymers were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and their thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The copolymers compositions were determined by elemental analysis. The monomer reactivity ratios have been calculated by linearization methods proposed by Kelen-Tudos and Fineman-Ross. The derived reactivity ratios (r1, r2) for (AM-co-MMA) are: (0.03, 0.593). The microstructure of copolymers and sequence distribution of monomers in the copolymers were calculated by statistical method based on the average reactivity ratios and found that these values are in agreement with the derived reactivity ratios.

Other, more complex models (such as penultimate unit effects or complex formation) require more kinetic parameters for a complete description. Published summaries of reactivity ratios list values for about 700 monomers taken from more than 1400 publications. These values represent an enormous amount of descriptive and physico\u2010chemical information about copolymerization in particular and free radical reactivity in general. It is important that we understand the limits to the numerical correctness of existing data, and that future data gathering be done in a statistically correct manner. In this paper several different linear and non\u2010linear regression approaches to estimating reactivity ratios are reviewed with emphasis being placed on the Mayo\u2010Lewis model. Two separate problems are recognized: the first is that of model discrimination, the second that of parameter estimation. It is rare that both problems can be properly treated with a single set of experiments, and we discuss the experimental approaches needed to obtain statistically good results.</jats:p>",

This water-soluble terpolymer has potential for applications in enhanced oil recovery, but the associated terpolymerization kinetic characteristics are largely unstudied. In the current paper, EVM is used to design optimal experiments (for the first time in the literature), and reactivity ratios are subsequently estimated based on both low and medium-high conversion data. The results from the medium-high conversion data are more precise than those from the low conversion data, and are therefore used next to predict the terpolymer composition trajectory over the full course of conversion. Good agreement is seen between experimental data and model predictions, which confirms the accuracy of the newly determined ternary reactivity ratios: r12 = 0.66, r21 = 0.82, r13 = 0.82, r31 = 0.61, r23 = 1.61, r32 = 0.25.</jats:p>",

Seven 35% solids (83 : 17 mol %) VDC\u2013BMA copolymer latexes were prepared: one batch (G), one seeded batch (F), and 5 seeded semicontinuous polymerizations of 5 different monomer feed rates ranging from 0.27 (A) to 1.10 wt %/min (E). The kinetic studies of seeded semicontinuous polymerizations A\u2010E showed that the rates of polymerizations (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub>) were controlled by the monomer addition rates (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>a</jats:italic></jats:sub>). The conversion versus time curves for the polymerizations of 0 : 100\u2013100 : 0 VDC\u2013BMA mixtures by batch polymerization showed that the rate of polymerization (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub>) was a function of the number of particles, and that the rate of polymerization in a latex particle (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>pp</jats:sub>) increased with increasing proportions of butyl methacrylate in the monomer mixture. All of the latexes had narrow particle size distributions. The greater particle number density in VDC polymerization and the greater water solubility of VDC suggest that the homogeneous nucleation mechanism is operative in VDC\u2013BMA copolymerizations. The latex copolymers prepared by semicontinuous polymerization had lower number\u2010and weight\u2010average molecular weights than those of the corresponding batch copolymers, resulting from the monomer starvation occurring during the semicontinuous polymerization. The surface characterization study of the cleaned latexes showed that for the latexes by batch process, the surface charge density derived from strong\u2010acid groups decreased with increasing proportion of VDC in the monomer mixture. On the other hand, for the latexes prepared by semicontinuous polymerization, the surface charge density derived from strong\u2010acid groups did not depend on the monomer composition of the copolymers.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios were estimated using the Finemann-Ross, inverted Fineman-Ross, Kelen-T\u00fcdos, extended Kelen-T\u00fcdos and Barson-Fenn graphical methods, along with the computer program COPOINT, modified to both the terminal and the penultimate models. According to COPOINT the reactivity ratios were found to be equal to 0.292 for NVP and 2.673 for IBMA for conventional radical polymerization, whereas for RAFT polymerization and for the penultimate model the following reactivity ratios were obtained: r11 = 4.466, r22 = 0, r21 = 14.830, and r12 = 0 (1 stands for NVP and 2 for IBMA). In all cases, the NVP reactivity ratio was significantly lower than that of IBMA. Structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions and the mean sequence length. The thermal properties of the copolymers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential thermogravimetry (DTG). The results were compared with those of the respective homopolymers.</jats:p>",

The obtained polymer consisted of a mixture of an ethylene\u2013styrene pseudorandom copolymer, polyethylene, and poly(styrene\u2010<jats:italic>block</jats:italic>\u2010ethylene) with a syndiospecific styrene\u2013styrene unit (SPS\u2010<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\u2010PE). In this work, from the whole polymer obtained with the CpTiCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/MAO catalyst system, the SPS\u2010<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\u2010PE copolymer was separated with the temperature rising elution fractionation method, and the structure was specified by <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR. The polymer obtained from the trivalent titanium catalyst, which was thought to be the active species of syndiotactic polystyrene, included both a styrene\u2013styrene sequence and a styrene\u2013ethylene\u2013ethylene\u2013styrene sequence. However, neither the styrene\u2013ethylene\u2013styrene sequence nor the long chain of polyethylene was included. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The compositions of six copolymers were in the range of allyl chloride units, 0.63\u20136.32 mol%. The monomer reactivity ratios r1 and r2 were calculated to be 6.04 and 0.035, respectively. Only three copolymers were soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide and their intrinsic viscosities were found to be greater than 4.5 dL g\u22121. The chlorine contents, although 0.42, 0.87, and 1.03 wt%, were sufficiently effective to cause a change in the behavior of the thermal degradation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN). In DTA curves measured at a rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121 under nitrogen for copolymers containing ca. 1 wt% of chlorine, a sharp exotherm due to the polymerization of cyano groups shifted to the higher-temperature side (ca. 40 \u00b0C) and the differential temperature decreased to about 1/6. Moreover, the weight loss at 350 \u00b0C decreased from 19 wt% for PAN to 13 wt%. A similar thermal-degradation behavior was also observed for acrylonitrile\u2013\u03b1-chloroacrylonitrile (CAN) copolymers. However, there was a great difference between allyl chloride and CAN units concerning the effect on the thermal degradation of PAN. Namely, only 1.5 mol% of allyl chloride units corresponded to 10 mol% of CAN units.</jats:p>",

From the results, the monomer reactivity ratios and the Alfrey-Price Q, and e values were determined. It was found that the relative reactivities toward the polystyryl radical were not correlated with the ordinary Hammett equation, but a linear relationship was obtained with a modified Hammett equation which contained a term of the resonance contribution by the substituents. Accordingly, it was considered that the reactivities of substituted phenyl methacrylates depend on both polar and resonance effects caused by the substituents.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sequential gas\u2010liquid chromotographic analysis of the reaction mixture throughout a copolymerization reaction in conjuction with the improved curve\u2010fitting <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> (integrated form) method, which accounts for measurements errors in both variables, allows accurate estimation of the monomer reactivity ratios. In this article an alternative method is presented for estimating <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values in copolymerization with linear regression only, which is especially suited to cases in which one or two of the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values is close to 1. In these cases the improved curve\u2010fitting <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> method tends to converge slowly because of the numerical instability of the integrated copolymerization equation. The use of the new method is illustrated for the estimation of the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values for ethylene and vinyl acatate in benzene at 35 kg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 62\u00b0C. The linear regression method was also tried on other copolymerizations and the results are compared with those obtained from the improved curve\u2010fitting <jats:italic>I</jats:italic> method. The limits of the applicability of the linear regression method were determined by simulated sequential sampling experiments. It appears that the new method is applicable when the product of the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values is between 0.001 and 2, provided both monomer conversions are large enough compared with the measurements error.</jats:p>",

Real time FTIR measurements were performed to monitor the depletion of each comonomer double bond during the isothermal curing reaction at 80\u00b0C. From the experimental data corresponding to different feed compositions, the initial reactivity ratios and their evolution with conversion were determined via a nonlinear least squares optimization of the integrated form of the copolymerization equation. The reactivity ratio of St increases continuously and exponentially with the overall reaction conversion, while that of BDMA decreases linearly. A modified terminal copolymerization model including the dependence of the reactivity ratios with the overall conversion was proposed. The application of this model provides a consistent fitting for the conversion of each comonomer during all reaction stages, even at high conversion values where large diffusion and topological restrictions for chain movements are present. Simulations show that the concentration of styrene units added to the copolymer increases with the overall reaction conversion, while that for the BDMA double bonds diminishes. Structures rich in homopolymerized styrene are predicted at later stages of the reaction.\u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>This investigation introduces the first estimation of ternary reactivity ratios for a butyl acrylate (BA), 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane (MDO), and vinyl acetate (VAc) system at 50 \u00b0C, with an aim to develop biodegradable pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). In this study, we applied the error-in-variables model (EVM) to estimate reactivity ratios. The ternary reactivity ratios were found to be r12 = 0.417, r21 = 0.071, r13 = 4.459, r31 = 0.198, r23 = 0.260, and r32 = 55.339 (BA/MDO/VAc 1/2/3), contrasting with their binary counterparts, which are significantly different, indicating the critical need for ternary system analysis to accurately model multicomponent polymerization systems. Through the application of a recast Alfrey\u2013Goldfinger model, this investigation predicts the terpolymer\u2019s instantaneous and cumulative compositions at various conversion levels, based on the ternary reactivity ratios. These predictions not only provide crucial insights into the incorporation of MDO across different initial feed compositions but also offer estimates of the final terpolymer compositions and distributions, underscoring their potential in designing compostable or degradable polymers.</jats:p>",

By employing the phenyl and benzyl esters of 2\u2010bromo\u20102\u2010methylpropionic acid as the initiators with 2,2\u2010bipyridyl and Cu(I)Cl it has been possible to use high field <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate in some detail the composition and structure of the branched PMMAs obtained. Parallel molar mass size exclusion chromatographic analysis using a multi\u2010angle light scattering detector with a refractive index detector (MALS/SEC) has allowed the branched architecture of the products to be confirmed. Rather remarkably, high yields of branched PMMAs can be obtained without crosslinking using MMA/EGDMA molar feed ratios of up to 5/1 by appropriate adjustment of the molar feed of initiator. In particular by maintaining the EGDMA/initiator molar feed ratio \u223c1/1 fully soluble products can be obtained that are densely branched since this feed ratio ensures that on average each living primary chain initiated contains on average only one branching EGDMA segment. As might be expected this controlled free radical process offers better control in the synthesis of branched polymer than the corresponding system we have reported using conventional free radical polymerization, and unlike the latter which requires the use of a chain transfer agent, the ATRP system requires no additional chain regulating component. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The goal is to present an alternative technique for reactivity ratio estimation in copolymerization. Typically, reactivity ratios are estimated using the instantaneous copolymer composition equation, based on low conversion copolymer composition data. However, using experimental data from the full copolymerization trajectory would, in principle, be more advantageous, and shy away from commonly used restrictive assumptions. Estimation using cumulative copolymerization data and models eliminates the difficulties associated with stopping reactions at low conversion, while one gains to study the full polymerization trajectory. The error\u2010in\u2010variables\u2010model (EVM) method is used for parameter estimation. Two cumulative model forms, the analytical integration of the differential composition equation and the one resulting from the direct numerical integration of this equation, are employed. Using these two types of models improves the reactivity ratio estimation and, in particular, the latter model form is a more reliable and direct method of estimating reactivity ratios. <jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/jpeg\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.jpg\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

A free\u2010radical solution polymerization technique was used for synthesizing homo\u2010 and copolymers of different feed compositions of PHPPMA and ethyl acrylate (EA) in EMK as a solvent with benzoyl peroxide as a free\u2010radical initiator at 70 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. All the polymers were characterized with IR and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR techniques. The compositions of the copolymers were determined with the <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR technique. The copolymer reactivity ratios were evolved with Kelen\u2013Tudos (EA = 1.25 and PHPPMA = 0.09) and extended Kelen\u2013Tudos (EA = 1.30 and PHPPMA = 0.09) methods. <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> (0.48) and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> (1.68) values for the new monomer (PHPPMA) were calculated with the Alfrey\u2013Price method. UV absorption spectra for poly(PHPPMA) showed two absorption bands at 302 and 315 nm. The photocrosslinking properties of the polymer samples were examined with the solvent method. Thermal analyses of the polymers were performed with the thermogravimetric\u2010differential thermogravimetric technique. First, the decomposition temperatures started for poly(PHPPMA), copoly(EA\u2010PHPPMA) (62:38), and copoly(EA\u2010PHPPMA) (41:59) were at 350, 410, and 417 \u00b0C, respectively.

A kinetic study of solution copolymerization in DMSO at 30 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C showed that the Py could not initiate copolymerization even after 20 h, whereas with AP as initiator, less than 1% conversion was observed. However, introduction of a Br in \u03b1\u2010methyl group of AP significantly enhanced the percent conversion.

The reaction order with respect to the initiator concentration was near to the theoretical one (0,5), while that with respect to the total monomer concentration was considerably higher than predicted by theory (1,0). It could be explained by the influence of transfer reactions and diffusion control of termination reactions. Transfer reactions contribute to the reaction order mainly at low monomer concentration, while the influence of the medium viscosity becomes predominant at high monomer concentration.</jats:p>",

In ACOMP systems, monomer and polymer concentrations are measured by the monitoring of two independent properties of the system. The reactivity ratios are found by taking into account errors in the monomer concentrations determined from measurements and from calibration of the instruments.

The approach is based on an algorithm for parameter estimation in ordinary differential equations and takes into account the partition of the comonomers between the different phases present in the system. Both copolymer composition and conversion were considered to be affected by experimental errors. The method was first checked by using simulated data that included random errors. The effect of the initial guess and level of errors on the values of the estimated reactivity ratios was investigated. Once the approach was checked, it was used to estimate the reactivity ratios of the styrene\u2013acrylonitrile system based on data obtained in unseeded batch emulsion copolymerizations of these monomers.</jats:p>",

The copolymer compositions were determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR. The reactivity ratios (\u03b3s) for the two copolymerization systems were determined analytically, based on Mayo\u2013Lewis equation, by fitting the calculated curves with the experimental data. The \u03b3s for the AN and VAc bulk copolymerization were found to be \u03b3<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> = 2.85 and \u03b3<jats:sub>21</jats:sub> = 0.11. The values of the apparent \u03b3s for the suspension copolymerization of AN, VAc, and SMAS were as follows: \u03b3<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> = 3.58, \u03b3<jats:sub>21</jats:sub> = 0.39, \u03b3<jats:sub>13</jats:sub> = 1.45, \u03b3<jats:sub>31</jats:sub> = 0, \u03b3<jats:sub>23</jats:sub> = 0.92, and the rate constant ratio <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>31</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>32</jats:sub> = 0.04.

The polymer\u2013comonomer mixture systems were so chosen as to permit study of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The homogeneous systems included systems of low and high viscosity. The heterogeneous systems included both polymers swollen by the comonomer mixture and polymers not swollen by the comonomer mixture. None of the homogeneous grafting systems studied showed deviations from the normal copolymerization behavior under a variety of experimental conditions. Monomer reactivity ratios in graft copolymerization were the same as the values in nongraft copolymerization. The heterogeneous systems in which the polymer was swollen by the comonomer mixture yielded grafted copolymer compositions which were the same as those in nongraft copolymerization. The heterogeneous grafting system polytetrafluoroethylene/styrene\u2013acrylonitrile showed deviations from normal copolymerization behavior at low degrees of grafting when the reaction was only on the polymer surface. The behavior became normal at higher degrees of grafting when the system approaches that in which the polymer is swollen by the comonomers. In all reaction systems, it was found that the use of radiation to initiate the reaction does not in any way affect the copolymerization behavior of the two monomers in a comonomer pair.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the reversible addition\u2013fragmentation transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of two monomers, even with the simple terminal model, there are two kinds of macroradical and two kinds of polymeric RAFT agent with different <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> groups. Because the structure of the <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> group could exert a significant influence on the RAFT process, RAFT copolymerization may behave differently from RAFT homopolymerization. The RAFT copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) in miniemulsion was investigated. The performance of the RAFT copolymerization of MMA/St in miniemulsion was found to be dependent on the feed monomer compositions. When St is dominant in the feed monomer composition, RAFT copolymerization is well controlled in the whole range of monomer conversion. However, when MMA is dominant, RAFT copolymerization may be, in some cases, out of control in the late stage of copolymerization, and characterized by a fast increase in the polydispersity index (PDI). The RAFT process was found to have little influence on composition evolution during copolymerization.

The monomer reactivity ratios were estimated by the Fineman\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f5s linear procedures. These parameters were also estimated by using a computer program based on a non\u2010linear minimization procedure known as Reactivity Ratios Error in Variables Model. Random copolymers and others containing blocks of one of the monomer units were obtained, depending on the chemical nature of the comonomers. The estimated comonomer sequence and distribution are discussed in terms of structural properties of the monomers such as molecular volume of the side groups, electronegativity of the substituents and steric hindrance. Analysis by comparison with other copolymers with analogous structures was also performed. Copyright \u00a9 2003 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The mechanism of the copolymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate has been investigated in mixtures of these monomers using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. The peroxide was decomposed both thermally and photochemically. Experiments on the composition of the polymer as a function of the monomer composition have given the reactivity ratios styrene radical-styrene molecule to styrene radical-butyl acrylate molecule as 0\u00b748 and butyl acrylate radical butyl acrylate molecule to butyl acrylate radical to styrene molecule as 0\u00b715. The kinetics of the copolymerization have been determined, and using the theory already elaborated for the treatment of such reactions, it has been shown by rate and molecular weight measurements that the styrene radicals react with the butyl acrylate radicals more quickly than the mean rate of reaction of styrene to styrene and butyl acrylate to butyl acrylate radicals. The coefficient \u00d8 defining this increased activity is not in this case constant and rises with increasing styrene content to a value of as much as 150. The initiation mechanism is also complicated in that there is no linear relation between the rate of initiation and monomer composition; instead, the rate drops rapidly when styrene is added to the butyl acrylate.</jats:p>",

In the St\u2010VA system, the large difference between the reactivity ratios of the two monomers causes a large error limit in values of 4, so that we could not find any essential regularities in the variation of 4 with successive mixing ratios. In the MM\u2010St system, however, where the difference of the two reactivity ratios is not so large, we can determine the values of 4 more precisely and obtain a concrete confirmation of Arlman's theory. As a result, we conclude that, for the MM\u2010St system (at. 24\u00b0C.), the termination constants for mixed radicals are larger than those for homogeneous radicals, and, furthermore, that the rate constant for a normal cross\u2010termination reaction is about 3 times larger than that of the cross\u2010termination reaction having a penultimate unit.</jats:p>",

Higher temperature made this phenomenon distinguishable and the degradation of \u03b1\u2010pyrrolidone was observed. The optimum temperature for polymerization was 90\u2013110\u00b0C. The stability of \u03b1\u2010pyrrolidone anion explains these phenomena, as this anion promotes alkaline\u2010salt formation and degradation and reduces the chain numbers. The prepared copolymers have low melting points and good solubilities which vary according to composition. The melting point of the copolymer whose composition is 1 mole caprolactam: 1 mole pyrrolidone is as low as 140\u00b0C. and this polymer shows good solubility in ethanol.

The glass\u2010transition temperature of poly(isocyanatoethyl methacrylate) was found to be 47\u00a0\u00b0C. From the thermogravimetric analysis of the weight\u2010loss percentage corresponding to the first wave of the thermogram, it was shown that the degradation mechanism of the IEM/MMA copolymers started from the isocyanate group. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Triphenyltin acrylate (TPTA), triphenyltin methacrylate (TPTMA), <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u2010acryloyloxytriphenyltin benzoate (TPTB) and triphenyltin itaconate (TPTI) monomers were prepared by the reactions of acrylic, methacrylic, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u2010acryloyloxybenzoic and itaconic acids, respectively, with triphenyltin hydroxide in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) as a dehydrating agent. Binary copolymerizations of PAB with TPTA, TPTMA, TPTB and TPTI were performed in dimethylformamide (DMF) using 1 mol% azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator at 65 \u00b0C. The structures of the monomers and copolymers were investigated by IR and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectrometry. The composition of the copolymers was determined by tin analysis. Copolymerization parameters for each system were calculated by both the Fineman\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f6s methods. The monomer reactivity ratios for the four systems studied, PAB\u2010TPTA, PAB\u2010TPTMA, PAB\u2010TPTB and PAB\u2010TPTI, were found to be <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.468, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 2.096; <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.435, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 2.292; <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.449, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 2.225 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.416, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 4.526, respectively.

Available information in regard of cationic copolymerizations has been treated in terms of three classes: (a) Systems in which the conventional copolymer composition equation adequately describes the copolymerization mechanism and previous authors justifiably used the two parameter model to calculate reactivity ratios. Our results show that the discrepancy between published <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values and the more precise values obtained in this work is about \u00b123%. (b) Systems in which the approximations implicit in the conventional copolymer composition equation do not hold and the calculated <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values are erroneous and misleading. Monomer pairs comprising monomers of significantly different reactivities belong to this class indicating that in copolymerizations in general and in cationic copolymerizations in particular a strong cast system exists, i.e., copolymerization can readily occur within the cast (between monomers of similar reactivities); however, only with difficulty if at all between casts (between monomers of differing reactivities). (c) Systems in which the use of the copolymer composition equation is completely unjustified, the calculated <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values are meaningless and in some cases the existence of true copolymers is questioned.</jats:p>",

While short\u2010chain branching for poly(t\u2010BuAAm) samples could not be detected by <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR, the reduced rate of monomer conversion with lowered monomer content indicates the formation of mid\u2010chain radicals (MCR) by backbiting. Adding water as a cosolvent to ethanol significantly increases reaction rates, in agreement with recent pulsed\u2010laser studies that quantify the influence of solvent composition on homopropagation kinetics.

In order to compute the reactivity ratios, we determined the copolymer composition by microanalysis of the carbon content. The evaluation of the data was carried out according to two procedures; the Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u00f6s linearization method and the non\u2010linear least\u2010squares of Tidwell and Mortimer. The ratios obtained with the latter, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>13</jats:sub> = 0,001 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>31</jats:sub> = 6,592, yielded a better fit. Different kinetic models were tested to describe the observed dependence of reaction rate on monomer mixture composition. The experimental results could be successfully described according to a kinetic model that assumes diffusion control of the termination reaction. The resulting kinetic equation contains two parameters whose values were determined from the experimental copolymerization rates. The value of one of these parameters could be obtained also from homopolymerization data for styrene. This proves that the parameters have physical significance and are not arbitrary quantities chosen to fit the experimental results.</jats:p>",

The results obtained from the copolymerization of ST with CMA in 1,4\u2010dioxane in the absence of a radical initiator are as follows: the copolymerization is strongly accelerated by UV\u2010irradiation; the monomer reactivity ratios of ST and CMA at 60\u00b0C are 0,06 and 0,00, respectively; the over\u2010all activation energy of the copolymerization is 77,4 kJ \u00b7 mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> (18,5 kcal \u00b7 mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>); the maximum rate of copolymerization at a constant total monomer concentration is observed at a mole fraction of ST of 0,4 to 0,5. The rate of copolymerization at equimolar feed composition is of second order with respect to the total monomer concentration. From the results obtained here and shown in the preceding paper, it was inferred that initiating radicals for the spontaneous copolymerization are formed through a charge transfer (CT) complex between the comonomers.</jats:p>",

The largely unstudied effect of IS on monomer reactivity ratios and copolymerization rates of acrylamide (AAm) and acrylic acid (AAc), in the form of sodium acrylate (NaAc), is investigated. Salt addition affects the nature of overall charges of the polyelectrolyte solution and diminishes the electrostatic repulsions between reacting chains. Therefore, changing the IS of the solution by incorporating salts affect not only the point estimates of the monomer reactivity ratios but also the overall behavior of the copolymerization (with a transition to azeotropic behavior).

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A vinyl monomer that has the nitrile or carbonyl group conjugated to the C\uf8feC double bond, such as acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate, forms a complex with an alkylaluminum halide, and the complex reacts spontaneously with a hydrocarbon monomer such as styrene, propylene, or ethylene, giving a high molecular weight copolymer. The copolymers always contain the two monomer units in 1:1 ratio. Thus styrene, copolymerized with methyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate in the presence of ethylaluminum sesquichloride in homogeneous toluene solution, gives such an equimolar copolymer regardless of the initial monomer compositions. The NMR spectra of these copolymers are distinctly different from those of the equimolar copolymers obtained with azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator and have simpler and well separated patterns. The copolymers and the corresponding radical copolymers appear to be amorphous, judged by their x\u2010ray diffraction patterns and their differential thermal analyses. Their infrared spectra resemble each other very closely. Hence, the difference in the NMR spectra may be ascribed to the matter of the sequence distribution. The infrared spectrum of ethylene\u2013methyl acrylate copolymer shows no absorption near 720 cm.<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> due to the methylene sequence arising from ethylene\u2013ethylene linkage. These experimental data lead to the inference that the equimolar copolymers obtained in this work may have an alternating sequence.</jats:p>",

In addition, the reaction order with respect to the initiator AIBN deviated from the standard free radical polymerization kinetics.

The polymerization reaction order declined from ideality as well, and the <jats:italic>E</jats:italic><jats:sub>a</jats:sub> and polymerization enthalpy changed with the batch composition variation, which could be explained through monomer/monomer, monomer/solvent, or monomer/polymer complexation.

Data obtained by the automatic continuous monitoring of copolymerization system, up to 80% conversion, are analyzed by an \u201cerror\u2010in\u2010variables method\u201d developed for obtaining the reactivity ratios by on\u2010line monitoring.

Although the terminal model describes the composition data well, it is seen to be inconsistent with the reaction rates. This discrepancy is attributed to implicit penultimate effects and using the recently developed calculation method, effective radical reactivity ratios are found as <jats:italic>s</jats:italic><jats:sub>VB</jats:sub> = 0.26 and <jats:italic>s</jats:italic><jats:sub>Aam</jats:sub> = 0.027, and both composition and rate data fit the implicit penultimate model extremely well. On\u2010line monitored data showed that in the reactions where the VB was completely consumed, the subsequent Aam homopolymerization was very rapid; thus, the reaction showed definitely two rate regimes, before and after VB depletion. Acrylamide take up rate also showed these two rate regimes. We conclude that low conversion results can be misleading and reactions must be monitored up to a high conversion for a robust control of composition and reaction kinetics. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The emulsion polymerization of vinylidene chloride is divisible into three stages: (I) a normal emulsion polymerization at a rate dependent on the 0.6 power of both the catalyst and surfactant concentration; (II) at a rate less than half that of I; (III) at a rate which increases in direct proportion to the catalyst concentration and independently of surfactant concentration. A careful examination of stirring rate has shown that the slowdown in stage II probably results from monomer starvation caused by slow diffusion of coalesced droplets, and that recovery in stage III is the result of transfer of monomer at the time of collision between a polymer particle and a monomer droplet. Extension of this work to copolymers of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile has shown a similar kinetic effect at high ratios of vinylidene chloride. The rate of polymerization for a system containing 90% vinylidene chloride decreases sharply after 15% conversion. The polymer formed increases in acrylonitrile content with conversion, reaches a maximum, and then decreases during stage III of the reaction. A run containing 70% vinylidene chloride in the charge did not show a slowdown but gave evidence of a maximum in the curve relating conversion and composition. At higher acrylonitrile content, no slowing occurred, and the polymer composition changed monotonically with conversion. Since acrylonitrile is partially soluble in water, the partition coefficient of acrylonitrile between vinylidene chloride and water was determined at concentrations similar to those used in the polymerizations. The partition coefficient decreases with increasing acrylonitrile concentration in the water phase. Apparent reactivity ratios were calculated on the basis of the monomer composition corrected for the water solubility of acrylonitrile and the initial composition of the copolymer. These values are <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.390 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.585, vinylidene chloride being considered to be the first monomer. The existence of a unique reactivity ratio indicates that the composition of the initial polymer is controlled only by the relative reactivities of the comonomers and the water solubility of acrylonitrile. The polymer formed later is also influenced by the rate of transport of vinylidene chloride to the reaction site. This is confirmed by the conversion curves and the manner in which composition changes with conversion.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>) were calculated by three different methods with good agreement. The values obtained for the monomer pairs are: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MAA</jats:sub> = 0.61 \u00b1 0.01, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>Cr</jats:sub> = 0.04 \u00b1 0.01; <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MAA</jats:sub> = 0.64 \u00b1 0.05, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>Cy</jats:sub> = 0.02 \u00b1 0.02.

The reaction was conducted in three stages; a further stage (called the steady stage, 2 h) was added to the traditionally stages (i.e., feed and seed stages) to improve considerably the monomer conversion. The monomer conversion and particle size distribution were studied by gravimetric and laser light scattering methods, respectively. The effects of variables such as agitation speed, emulsifier concentration, initiator concentration, feeding rate and comonomers ratio were fully investigated based on the monomer conversion\u2010time profiles and the particle size distribution to find the optimized copolymerization conditions. Increasing the agitation speed had a negative effect on the monomer conversion, but reduced coagulation of polymer particles. Monomer conversion could be improved by increasing the initiator or emulsifier contents. Feeding rate increased the polymer particle size sharply; however, it showed no significant effect on conversion. The final conversions were as high as 97\u201399% and they were recognized to be independent of the comonomers ratios employed. Morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy showed nano\u2010sized isolated particles which were partially aggregated. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010</jats:p>",

Thermal properties of the copolymers were studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and kinetics of their thermal degradation by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Thermogravimetry (DTG), applying the isoconversional methodologies of Ozawa\u2013Flynn\u2013Wall (OFW) and Kissinger\u2013Akahira\u2013Sunose (KAS).</jats:p>",

Copolymerization led, as usual, to the simultaneous formation of grafted and non\u2010grafted poly(vinyl acetate\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010methyl acrylate). The reactivity ratios of VAc and MA were determined from high\u2010conversion data by using an integrated form of the copolymerization equation.

The capacity of the methods for determining reactivity ratios based on the differential copolymerization equation is discussed for the present copolymerization system. Some significant characteristics of the copolymer and the copolymerization reaction are deduced from the copolymerization parameters. It is concluded that the polymerization sites of the grafting and homopolymerization reactions are identical. Also, the present aqueous dispersion technique yields similar results as bulk polymerizations.</jats:p>",

Effect of different comonomers on the polymerization kinetics and viscosity of the spinning drop are discussed in detail. The exothermic reaction of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursors is determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and effect of the different comonomers on the stabilization exotherm properties of PAN precursors were also studied. It has been shown that the rate of polymerization decreases distinctly with an increase of IA content, the ammonium modification can obviously increase the hydrophilicity of copolymer. The falling ball viscosity of AN/IA system is lower when compared with the other three systems, but when under the low concentration of monomer, AN/MA system has the highest viscosity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) indicates that the peak width change for the different copolymer be mainly caused by the spin-spin interaction.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Polyacrylonitrile is an important polymer that is widely used in the manufacture of synthetic fibers, particularly for applications in apparel. Although a vast amount of literature is available on the polymerization process of acrylonitrile (AN) with other monomers, there are few reports of studies on polymerization in a mixed solvent of water with an organic solvent. It is conceivable that this method could combine the advantages of the solution and suspension polymerization methods. Synthesis of AN copolymers with two vinyl acids, methacrylic acid (MAA) and itaconic acid (IA), is carried out by solvent\u2013water suspension polymerization. The polymerizations are performed with an equal ratio mixture of dimethylformamide as a solvent and water as a nonsolvent at 60\u00b0C using \u03b1,\u03b1\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator. The kinetics of polymerization are studied by plotting the conversion versus reaction time for different mole ratios of AN with vinyl acids. Copolymers are characterized by FTIR and capillary viscometery. The results show that IA depresses the rate of polymerization more than MAA in this reaction medium, and this effect becomes more significant at higher vinyl acid mole ratios. High conversion in a short reaction time is obtainable for copolymers with a low vinyl acid mole fraction. However, for mole ratios of more than 93:7, the rate of the reaction is drastically reduced and low conversion (&lt;60%) results, even after 8 h. The intrinsic viscosities of all cases are surprisingly high. Although they are reduced with increasing acidic comonomer mole fraction, this reduction is more significant for IA compared to MAA. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The drift in monomer composition is measured during copolymerization by in situ NMR over a range of initial AA molar fractions and monomer weight fractions up to 0.35 at 50 \u00b0C. The copolymer becomes enriched in MAPTAC for monomer mixtures containing up to 60 mol% MAPTAC, but is enriched in AA for MAPTAC-rich mixtures; this azeotropic behavior is dependent on initial monomer content, as electrostatic interactions from the cationic charges influence the system reactivity ratios. Models for MAPTAC homopolymerization and AA-MAPTAC copolymerization are developed to represent the rates of monomer conversion and comonomer composition drifts over the complete range of experimental conditions.</jats:p>",

Most of the styrene was solubilized in the palisade layer of the microemulsion, whereas the acrylonitrile had an equilibrium distribution in the aqueous phase and palisade layer of the microemulsion. The reactivity ratios of styrene and acrylonitrile in the microemulsion system were different from those in other media. The effect of the monomer feed composition on the copolymerization kinetics was investigated, and the mechanism of nucleation of the latex particles was examined. The experimental results showed that the copolymerization loci were changed from the microemulsion droplets to the aqueous phase when the concentration of acrylonitrile in the monomer feed reached approximately 80%; this could be further proved by the effect of the monomer feed composition on the copolymerization kinetics. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the basis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the monomer reactivity ratios were calculated. The amount of ligand played an important role in copolymerization.

Since both VS and VE undergo alternative copolymerization with MAn, these terpolymerizations were approximately treated on the basis of the free propagation and complex propagation mechanisms. From the treatment of the free propagation mechanism in which only three free monomers can participate, the reactivity of the free VS toward attack of the poly(MAn) radical was found to be 4.24 to 6.63 times higher than that of free VE, and the difference in activation energy was 1.5 kcal/mole. The higher reactivity of VS than VE might be explained by the 3 d orbital resonance between the propagating radical and the adjacent sulfur atom in VS. According to the complex propagation mechanism in which only two complexed monomers can participate, the reactivity ratios of the MAn/VS and MAn/VE complex monomers were also determined. It was found that the former complex was more reactive than the latter complex toward the poly(MAn) radical.</jats:p>",

The polymerization rate at an equimolar monomer composition is proportional to the 1.0 power of the dose rate. The dose rate dependency of higher than 0.5 may be ascribed to unimolecular termination due to a degradative chain transfer of propagating radicals to propylene. The <jats:italic>G</jats:italic> values of the initiating radical formation and the polymerization reaction were calculated to be 1.78 and 1336, respectively.

The effects of feed molarity, feed composition, reaction time, and temperature on graft yield (%<jats:italic>G</jats:italic>) and other grafting parameters were investigated. The determination of rate of ceric (IV) ions disappearance as a function of feed molarity and reaction time was useful in the determination of the rate of ceric (IV) ions consumption during graft copolymerization. The graft yield (%<jats:italic>G</jats:italic>) in the presence of acrylamide increases because of the synergistic effect of acrylamide comonomer. The composition of the grafted chains (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>AAm</jats:sub>) varies on varying the feed composition and reaction temperature but is almost constant during feed molarity variation. The Mayo and Lewis method was used to determine the reactivity ratios of acrylamide (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and methylacrylate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), which are 0.65 and 1.07, respectively. The product of reactivity ratio (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\n<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is less then unity; hence, an alternate arrangement of comonomer blocks in the grafted copolymer chain is proposed. The rate of graft copolymerization of comonomers onto cellulose is second power to the concentration of comonomers and square root to the concentration of ceric ammonium nitrate. Suitable reaction steps for graft copolymerization of comonomers onto cellulose are proposed. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 86: 2631\u20132642, 2002</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The infrared absorption spectra of polymers and copolymers of methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate have been measured, and then used as the basis of a spectrophotometric method for the analysis of the copolymers. The 6.73 \u03bc band, which may be due to methyl (\u2013C\u2013CH3) vibration, was selected as the key band for measuring the methyl methacrylate component, while the 6.89 \u03bc band was used as the standard. The monomer reactivity ratios for copolymerization of methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate system have been determined to be r1=0.5\u00b10.1, and r2=2.3\u00b10.4 (M1 methyl acrylate, M2; methyl methacrylate) at 130\u00b0C. These values are in good agreement with those previously obtained by the deuterium tracer method. It has also been shown that the procedure used in this study is appropriate for the analyses of methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymers.</jats:p>",

In the copolymerization of vinyl cyclohexane with acrylonitrile the copolymer composition depends on the ratio of acrylonitrile to AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. If this ratio is unity, alternating copolymers of the composition 1:1 are formed; with a ratio greater than unity statistical copolymers that contain more than 50% acrylonitrile units are produced. The <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectroscopy measurements indicate that the interaction between the comonomers and the complexing agent leads to the formation of ternary donor\u2013acceptor complexes of equimolar composition. The equilibrium constants of these complexes at \u221260\u00b0C have been determined. The effects of temperature, nature of solvent and dilution on the yield, and composition of the copolymers of vinyl cyclohexane with acrylonitrile formed have been studied. By lowering the temperature the yield of copolymers increases but their composition remains equimolar. An increase in the polarity of the medium results in an increase in copolymer yield, whereas the yield decreases if the reaction is conducted in a donor\u2010solvent medium. Dilution of the reaction mixture disrupts the alternation of units in the macrochain of copolymers. The kinetic pecularities of copolymerization have been investigated. The linear dependence of the copolymerization rate on the product of comonomer concentration is observed. The rate of copolymerization is proportional to the square root of the incident light intensity. Various additions of radical type and irradiation accelerate the process of copolymerization. The mechanism of alternating copolymerization of vinyl cyclohexane monomers with acrylonitrile in the presence of AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is discussed in terms of homopolymerization of the comonomer complex.</jats:p>",

Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis data showed an improvement in the thermal behaviour of the investigated copolymers compared with that of poly(acrylonitrile). Mechanisms illustrating the role of both the acidic group and the maleimide ring in the nitrile oligomerization were proposed. The produced copolymers showed an excellent affinity towards basic dyes and better color fastness towards UV light.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With a Monte Carlo simulationmethod, copolymer properties have been thoroughly studied, and the influence of the reactivity ratios and feed composition has been taken into consideration. Instantaneous alterations of the copolymer composition and copolymer heterogeneity, which is also called a randomness parameter, have been examined with data obtained from the simulation at each stage of the copolymerization reaction. The results prove the azeotropic behavior of copolymerization reactions in which both reactivity ratios are greater than unity, although some special reactivity ratio combinations ignore the azeotropic behavior. The copolymer composition reaches an azeotrope point at the end of the copolymerization reaction when the copolymerization is an azeotropic reaction. In addition, the randomness parameter takes its maximum value at the azeotrope point when reactivity ratio <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>A</jats:sub></jats:italic> is equal to reactivity ratio <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>B</jats:sub></jats:italic>.

A convenient laboratory procedure for the sodium-catalyzed copolymerization of butadiene and styrene has been described. Earlier attempts to accomplish this probably failed because the monomers were not sufficiently pure. 2. The copolymer of butadiene and styrene which results from sodium polymerization is different from the emulsion copolymer, GR-S, in several important respects. The sodium-catalyzed copolymer has a more nearly constant styrene content at different stages of conversion; it is made up of molecules with a relatively narrow molecular weight spread; it has a higher intrinsic viscosity; it is 100 per cent soluble in benzene (i.e., there is no gel) even at 100 per cent conversion; when treated with standard rubber antioxidant, it ages better; and it has a greater amount of the butadiene joined in the 1,2 manner (i.e., greater vinyl side-chain content). 3. The effects of such variables as temperature of polymerization, method of adding the monomer mixture to the catalyst, size of catalyst particles, and possible butadiene impurities on the polymerization have been studied. 4. The method has been extended to cover copolymerization of butadiene and m-methylstyrene to give a soluble copolymer of low molecular weight. Other styrene-type monomers gave less interesting copolymers.</jats:p>",

A heretofore unrecognized possibility for approaching the problem of general monomer reactivity relationships appears to lie in the consideration of terpolymers. The relationship between monomer and terpolymer compositions is given by the equations\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nA more general and yet simplified relationship underlying terpolymers which has not been previously recognized is derived. This relationship is shown to hold for a wide range of monomer types and concentrations. The overall probability of initiating a, c, and b sequences immediately preceded by b, a, and c, respectively, and of undefined terminating units is equal to the probability of terminating a, c, and b sequences with b, a, and c units, respectively, but of undefined initiating units. This relationship of product probabilities is as follows:\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nand is shown to hold for numerous terpolymer and related copolymer systems. It follows that\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nMethods are presented for predicting the behavior of monomers A and C in copolymerization when the behaviors of A\u2010B and B\u2010C are known. Furthermore, it is shown that the value of eq. (3) is frequently in the range of 0.02\u20130.06. This result is probably related to the fact that terpolymerization of monomers of equal reactivity in equimolar concentrations will yield product probabilities equal to 0.037.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous work with anionic copolymerizations held that the terminal carbanion played no role in determining which monomer was next added. Recent work by Graham et al. has demonstrated that this is untrue for monomers of extremely dissimilar polarities. In this paper the kinetics of copolymerization of dissimilar monomers has been developed. As a result it is shown that the ratio of monomers in the initial copolymer <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>[M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>]/<jats:italic>d</jats:italic>[M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] is directly proportional to the square of the initial monomer ratio ([M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>]/[M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>])<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> when the monomers are dissimilar. The earlier theory resulted in a first\u2010power proportionality for all cases.

The conclusion is drawn that values of <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> of 1.0 and 2.0 represent extremes of behavior for monomers of very similar and very dissimilar polarites. As a corollary of this it is concluded that reactivity ratios for these systems where <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> is not 1.0 are of questionable theoretical significance.</jats:p>",

The hydrosoluble yields in final latexes are not larger than 1.3\u20135%, depending on the concentration of NaMA used. Below 25% conversion, the change of conversion with reaction time follows the square rule and the particle size is proportional to the 2/3 power of time. Above 25% conversion, serious gel effect occurs, and the conversion follows the seventh power on time and the growth of particle diameter obeys the 2.5 power on time. The multiple glass transition (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>g</jats:italic></jats:sub>) occur below 20% conversion, where monomer droplets exist.

Terminal, penultimate, and \u201ccomplex\u201d copolymerization models were applied by using the data of composition of the copolymers obtained in bulk and by copolymerization in benzene, ethyl acetate, and chloroform. The model based on the participation of the monomer complexes describes satisfactorily the deviation from the terminal copolymerization model. The proton NMR analyses of the monomer mixtures indicate that the interaction between the monomers leads to the formation of weak monomer complexes. Kinetic studies of the initial rate dependence on the total monomer concentration and monomer feed composition enabled us to evaluate the degree of participation of the free uncomplexed monomers and the monomer complex in the propagation reactions. The contribution of the complexed monomers in the propagation stages increases with the increase in total monomer concentration. The initial rate of the copolymerization is proportional to the square root of the initiator concentration, thus confirming the bimolecular termination of the macrochains. The rate constants of the addition reactions of the complex and free monomers were evaluated from the kinetic studies. The quantitative kinetic treatment provided information regarding the relative weight of the termination reaction and indicated that the termination in the system occurs predominantly by the cross\u2010termination reaction between two growing polymer radicals with different kinds of monomer units at the ends. Additional information on the termination in this system was obtained from viscosity measurements.</jats:p>",

The various probabilities include the possibilities of adding A, B, or C monomers to any of the corresponding radicals and can be expressed in terms of binary reactivity ratios. At equimolar concentrations it is shown that for systems of three conjugated or three unconjugated monomers  approximates 0.037. Similarly, for systems of two conjugated and one unconjugated monomers or two unconjugated and one conjugated monomers  approximates 0.006. Once the appropriateness of these constants is established, it is shown how the relationship may be used to assess the most probable values among widely varying reported reactivity ratios. It is shown that the values of the constant  for different combinations of monomers allow the assessment of the reactivity of conjugated monomers compared with unconjugated monomers for conjugated or unconjugated radicals. It develops that the reactivity of unconjugated monomers is between 5 and 10% of that of conjugated monomers for unconjugated radicals. For more precise assessment of unknown reactivity ratios it is suggested that  is a product function of unique reactivity parameters characteristic of the individual monomers involved.</jats:p>",

The addition of a low amount of TFMA improved the control of the polymerization of VDF without using any surfactant. Also, the size of particles, assessed by light scattering, was smaller than 200 nm. The addition of TFMA in low proportions, that is, 5 to 10 mol %, enabled us to stabilize the particle size and to decrease the size by one order of magnitude. The emulsifying behavior of TFMA (in low amount in the copolymer, that is, &lt;10 mol %) was similar to those achieved when a surfactant was added.

Investigations on the influence of the concentration of initiator upon the reaction rate gave evidence of a change in the mechanism of termination reaction at higher concentrations of initiator in the system. The molecular weights of the copolymers, at sufficiently long residence times, were constant. The composition of the copolymers obtained was in accordance with theoretical anticipations. Some discrepancies between the equations derived and the experimental results were tentatively explained on the basis of the influence of the heterogeneous nature of the system.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Two new techniques for the determination of monomer reactivity ratios in copolymerization under high\u2010pressure conditions have been developed, viz., the \u201csandwich\u201d and the \u201cquenching\u201d method. Both methods are based on repeated quantitative gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture during the low\u2010pressure stages preceding and succeeding the high\u2010pressure stage, of which the kinetics is under investigation. Application of the \u201csandwich\u201d method implies the occurrence of reaction during both low\u2010pressure stages and consequently the low\u2010pressure kinetic data are required to obtain the transition points of low to high pressure and vice versa. These points constitute the initial and final conditions of the relevant high\u2010pressure reaction. On the contrary, in the \u201cquenching\u201d method no reaction occurs during the low\u2010pressure stages, owing to the lower temperature and the high activation energy of the initiator decomposition. As a consequence, the initial and final conditions of the high\u2010pressure stage can be determined by a simple averaging procedure. Both methods have been tested for the ethylene\u2014vinyl acetate copolymerization at 62\u00b0C and 600 kg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> with <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl alcohol as solvent, and appear to lead to almost identical monomer reactivity ratios, although the \u201cquenching\u201d method is slightly preferred in case of copolymerization reactions. Both methods are particularly valuable when one of the reactants is gaseous or the reaction produces a gas. Further merits and drawbacks of both methods are discussed.</jats:p>",

The initiator used was 2,2\u2032\u2010azobis 2,4\u2010dimethyl valeronitrile (ADVN). Polymerizations were carried out to moderately high conversions, necessitating the use of a modified parameter estimation method to determine the reactivity ratios.

The variation of \u03d5 could also be caused by chain transfer to the solvent retarding the reaction rate. Such a possibility is consistent with the observed reduction in the molecular weight of the copolymer in the presence of the solvent. The approach to steady\u2010state in the reactor was characterized. It was not possible to obtain good agreement between experiment and simulation with a single value of the \u03d5 factor.</jats:p>",

The rate of copolymerization increases up to 20 \u2013 40% conversion of both monomers and then gradually decreases to zero. The increase in the copolymerization rate is more pronounced for equimolar ratios [S]/[MAn] as compared to ratios with an excess of S. For a given mole ratio of S and MAn the copolymerization rate in 1,4\u2010dioxane is higher at higher total monomer concentrations and/or at higher temperatures. The heat of copolymerization is 81,6 kj \u00b7 mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> for the equimolar [S]/[MAn] mixture. For mixtures with [S]/[MAn] &gt; 1 the heat of reaction is between 70 and 80 kj \u00b7 mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>. The limitingconversion of styrene for [S]/[MAn] = 1 is about 98%, and for [S]/[MAn] &gt; 1 it is a function of the [S]/[MAn] ratio.

Copolymerization reactions were conducted in toluene at three different temperatures with varied E/P ratios. Some typically obtained copolymers were characterized in detail using <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C\u2010NMR spectroscopy, by which triad distribution data were elaborated in a statistical method to determine the reactivity ratios (<jats:italic>r<jats:sub>E</jats:sub></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>P</jats:sub></jats:italic>) of the comonomers, which were also obtained by Fineman\u2010Rose estimation. The production of alternating\u2010like copolymers from EBI is attributed to the rapid interconversion between two conformation states of the active site, one of which favors the incorporation of propylene but the other one does not. Both SiPh and MBu are structurally more rigid and of larger dihedral angles than EBI; however, SiPh which owns open active site conformation tend to produce random copolymers at all studied temperatures, and for MBu, sterically hindered catalyst, block\u2010like copolymers were obtained. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Copolymer properties and processability depend on copolymer microstructure, i.e., copolymer composition and monomer unit arrangements along the copolymer chains. To predict the ultimate properties of copolymers, one needs complete information on the length and position of sequences of each monomer type in every chain. A versatile kinetic Monte Carlo code is developed and applied for the simulation of typical free radical copolymerizations. The code allows explicit monitoring of every growing chain during the course and at the end of polymerization, can account for comonomer systems of any arbitrary reactivity ratios (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) over the full range of monomer composition. Meanwhile, it eliminates the need for solving arrays of differential equations arising from deterministic modeling approaches. Since the code virtually synthesizes billions of copolymer molecules and keeps in storage information on each and every copolymer chain in the system, it allows for detailed statistical analysis. The simulator visualizes the bivariate sequence length\u2013chain length distribution for typical copolymerization systems and examples with: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> &lt; 1 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 1; <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> &gt; 1 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 1; (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> \u00d7 <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) = 1; and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 1, and is also applied successfully to an experimental scenario described in the literature.</jats:p>",

When the graft copolymerization of methyl methacrylate on cellulose with adsorbed ceric ion was carried out by irradiation with ultraviolet light, the percent grafting decreased for softwood, bleached sulfite pulp and increased for hardwood semichemical pulp. The average molecular weight of the grafts was observed generally to decrease. If it is assumed that the ceric ions, which are reduced at an accelerated rate in the early stages of reaction with SCP, do not participate in the graft formation, a relation is observed between the modified amount of reduced ceric ion and the number of grafted chains formed, and the molar ratios of these quantities are 12:1 without irradiation and 75:1 to 100:1 with irradiation. Even when the rate of reduction of ceric ion is accelerated, the increase in the number of grafted chains is found to be very small.</jats:p>",

The grafting efficiency and homogeneity of copolymer were determined by the fractionation and measurement of dynamic viscoelasticity of emulsion polymers. As the content of the second fraction of acetone\u2010soluble part increased and that of the third fraction decreased, then the homogeneity of the copolymer increased, In this case, only one dynamic loss peak existed near 0\u00b0C. The result showed that homogeneous copolymers were obtained by continuous monomer addition methods and heterogeneous copolymers were obtained by initial addition of total monomers or stepwise monomer addition methods. Homogeneity of copolymer had great influence on various properties, e.g., hardness and adhesive properties. Film hardness was the lowest for homogeneous copolymer and it was the highest for heterogeneous copolymer. Homogeneous copolymer was best for adhering plywood and poly(vinyl chloride). It is remarkable that copolymers of vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate with very different properties were obtained by changing only the monomer addition methods.</jats:p>",

Copolymerizations of MAD with cyclohexyl and <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\u2010butyl acrylate resulted in copolymers with \u03c9\u2010unsaturated end groups, and increasing the temperature up to 180 \u00b0C resulted in an increase in the rate of \u03b2 fragmentation of MAD radicals relative to propagation. Only a small amount of unsaturated end groups was introduced by copolymerization with ethyl methacrylate (EMA), and the EMA content in the copolymer increased with temperature. These findings could be explained by the reversible addition of the poly(EMA) radical to MAD. The copolymerization with ethyl \u03b1\u2010ethyl acrylate (EEA) did yield a copolymer containing unsaturated end groups with MAD units as part of the main chain, although the steric hindrance of the ethyl group suppressed homopropagation and crosspropagation of EEA, resulting in low polymerization rates. Therefore, the copolymerization of MAD with acrylic esters at high temperatures was noted as a convenient route for obtaining acrylate\u2013MAD copolymers bearing unsaturated end groups at the \u03c9 end (macromonomer). \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Besides the styrenic copolymers, copolymers containing a hard phase of methyl methacylate and methyl acrylate were also synthesized. Comonomer droplets with a narrow size distribution and fair uniformity were prepared using an SPG (Shirasu porous glass) membrane having pore size of 0.90 \u03bcm. After the single\u2010step SPG emulsion, the emulsion droplets were composed mainly of monomers, hydrophobic additives, and an oil\u2010soluble initiator, suspended in the aqueous phase containing a stabilizer and inhibitor. These were then transferred to a reactor, and subsequent suspension polymerization was carried out. Uniform copolymer particles with a mean diameter ranging from 3 to 7 \u03bcm, depending on the recipe, with a narrow particle size distribution and a coefficient of variation of about 10% were achieved. Based on the glass\u2010transition temperatures, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry, the resulting copolymer particles containing a soft phase of acrylate were better compatibilized with a hard phase of methyl methacrylate than with styrene with dioctyl phthalate (DOP) addition. Glass\u2010transition temperatures of poly(MMA\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010MA) particles were strongly affected by the composition drift in the copolymer caused by their substantial difference in reactivity ratios. Incorporation of DOP in the copolymer particles does not significantly affect the glass\u2010transition temperature of MMA\u2010 or MA\u2010containing copolymer particles, but it does affect the St\u2010containing copolymer and particle morphology of the copolymers. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The growing end radicals were identified as a methyl methacrylate radical for the AlCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> complex\u2013styrene system and a styrene radical for the SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> complex\u2013styrene system by the measurement of the ESR spectra of the copolymerization systems under or after irradation with a high\u2010pressure mercury lamp. The tacticity of the resulting polymer appears to be controlled by the structure of the charge transfer complex. In the case of the SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> complex a certain interaction of SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> with the growing end radical seems to be a factor controlling the polymer structure. These copolymerizations can be explained by an alternating charge\u2010transfer complex copolymerization scheme.</jats:p>",

Investigations have focused almost entirely on thermally initiated systems. However, very few investigations have been conducted on light\u2010initiated radical copolymerization. In this study, the photoinitiated copolymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride is investigated without the use of an external radical source, such as the classical 2,2\u2010azobis(2\u2010methylpropionitrile) (AIBN), benzoyl peroxide (BPO), or any photoinitiators. The initiation of the polymerization is instead found to take place through an excited state biradical generated in situ from a photoexcited charge\u2010transfer complex (CTC) comprising the donor (styrene) and acceptor (maleic anhydride) monomers. The formation of the complex is found to be solvent dependent.

The extent of acrylamide grafting increased in the presence of the EA comonomer. The composition of the grafted chains (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>AAm</jats:sub> = 0.52) was found to be constant during the feed molarity variation from 7.5 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> to 60.0 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>, whereas the composition of the grafted chains (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>AAm</jats:sub>) was found to be dependent on feed composition (<jats:italic>f</jats:italic><jats:sub>AAm</jats:sub>) and reaction temperature. The effects of ceric(<jats:sc>IV</jats:sc>) ion concentration, reaction time and temperature on the grafting parameters have been studied. The grafting parameters showed an increasing trend up to 6.0 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> concentration of CAN at a feed molarity of 30.0 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> and showed a decreasing trend on further increasing the concentration of CAN (&gt;6.0 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>) at a constant concentration of nitric acid (5.0 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>). The composition of the grafted chains (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>AAm</jats:sub>) was determined by IR spectroscopy and nitrogen content and the data obtained then used to determine the reactivity ratios of the acrylamide (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and ethyl acrylate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) comonomers by using a Mayo and Lewis plot. The reactivity ratios of acrylamide and ethyl acrylate were found to be <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.54 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 1.10, respectively, and hence the sequence lengths of acrylamide (m\u0304<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and ethyl acrylate (m\u0304<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) in the grafted chains are arranged in an alternating form, as the product of the reactivity ratios of acrylamide and ethyl acrylate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> \u00d7 <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is less than unity. The rate of graft copolymerization of the comonomers onto cellulose was found to be dependant on the \u2018squares\u2019 of the concentrations of the comonomers and on the \u2018square root\u2019 of the concentration of ceric ammonium nitrate. The energy of activation (\u0394<jats:italic>E</jats:italic><jats:sub>a</jats:sub>) of graft copolymerzation was found to be 5.57 kJ mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> within the temperature range from 15 to 50 \u00b0C.

Fractionation of the copolymers with acetonitrile and the NMR spectra of the insoluble fractions show that these are block copolymers which consist of a polystyrene portion and a poly(methyl methacrylate) portion. When the copolymerization is stopped at low conversion the copolymer has a high styrene content, which sometimes exceeds the value expected for radical copolymerization. This fact would indicate that styrene is preferentially polymerized at the early stages of chain propagation. When the copolymerization is carried to high conversion some crosslinked polymer is formed which contains more styrene than the soluble part of the same experiment. When a piece of metallic lithium is used as initiator, it is found that the crosslinked polymer is formed on the surface of the metal. The addition of lithium phenoxide or \u03b2\u2010naphthoxide to the system eliminates the formation of crosslinked polymer. A possible mechanism is proposed.</jats:p>",

Therefore, partially fluorinated polymers have recently been reported. As an easy-to-handle fluorine-containing monomer, \u03b1-trifluoromethylstyrene (TFMST) can be used to produce partially fluorinated polymers with trifluoromethyl groups in the main chain; however, TFMST does not homopolymerize, and there are limited reports on its copolymerization with styrene (ST). In this study, we applied the controlled radical polymerization method, which is effective for the polymerization of ST, to the copolymerization of TFMST and ST. We also showed that nitroxide-mediated polymerization is effective. The content ratio of TFMST in the TFMST\u2013ST copolymer can be controlled between 10% and 40% by changing its monomer ratio. Additionally, the polymerization of TFMST and ST with substituents was performed to increase structural variations. The thermal stability as well as water and oil repellency of the synthesized polymers with different composition ratios and substituents were also evaluated.</jats:p>",

The introduction of VOCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> to the polymerization systems studied was found to cause an enhancement in the copolymerization yield and a decrease of the copolymer intrinsic viscosity; it has not, however, a significant influence on the copolymer composition.</jats:p>",

The nature of active centers and the mechanism of polymerization in these systems have been studied by means of ESR measurements in combination with calorimetry at low temperatures. The active centers are monoradicals propagating by alternative addition of single monomer molecules; thus the reaction can be described in terms of a conventional kinetic scheme of radical additional polymerization. Participation of binary donor\u2014acceptor complexes of the monomers in the reaction has not been confirmed. Similar conclusions have been drawn for the other alternating system studied, maleic anhydride\u20132,3\u2010dimethylbutadiene. The feasibility of formation of alternating copolymers in the studied systems by the conventional mechanism of binary radical copolymerization has been confirmed by qualitative quantum\u2010chemical treatment of the propagation reactions with due account to the donor\u2013acceptor interactions in the transition state.</jats:p>",

The initiator used in this study, 2,2\u2032\u2010azobis\u20102,4\u2010dimethyl valeronitrile was selected on the basis of its high decomposition rate constant. Measurements included the rate of copolymerization, the copolymer composition by infrared spectrophotometric analysis, the molecular weight distribution by gel permeation chromatography, and the viscosity of the reaction mixture by capillary viscometry. The reactivity ratios for the EHA\u2013VCLAC pair were markedly different so that both propagating chains preferentially add EHA. Both the \u03d5 factor and the penultimate effect models were inadequate for describing the termination reaction. By defining an appropriate expression, based on physicochemical considerations, for the overall termination rate constant, it was possible to model the steady state rates by the diffusion model of Atherton and North. An attempt to model the transient behavior of the reactor by using the \u03d5 value as an adaptable correction factor was unsuccessful due to the rapid composition drift during approach to steady state. The measured conversions were lower than the model predictions for all feed ratios.</jats:p>",

The activity of a catalyst treated by ethylene/1\u2010butene prepolymerization \u201cprep\u2010cat\u20102\u201d for the copolymerization is not affected by the monomer composition in the range of 0\u201310 mol\u2010% of 1\u2010butene, but it is higher than that of the homopolymerization of ethylene with a catalyst treated by ethylene prepolymerization \u201cprep\u2010cat\u20101\u201d. Comparative studies of the polymerizations in the gas\u2010phase and in slurry reactors showed differences in the rate\u2010time profiles. The higher activities in the early stage and declining kinetics for the gas\u2010phase polymerizations can be considered to be due to the higher macroparticle diffusivity and to fast deactivation of the active centres which has been confirmed by the determination of the oxidation state of titanium in the catalyst.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The principal deficiency of the widely utilized Alfrey<jats:italic>\u2013</jats:italic>Price (AP) scheme for computing reactivity ratios in the widely used free radical copolymerization is that it ignores important factors, such as the steric effects. This often leads to inaccurate reactivity ratio predictions by AP model. Accordingly, in this study, exclusively data-driven,<jats:italic>Q\u2013e</jats:italic>parameter-based new models have been developed for the reactivity ratio prediction in free radical copolymerization. In the model development, a novel artificial intelligence formalism known as \u201c<jats:italic>genetic programming</jats:italic>(GP)\u201d that performs symbolic regression has been employed. The GP-based models possess a different functional form than AP model. Further, parameters of GP-based models were fine-tuned using<jats:italic>Levenberg\u2013Marquardt</jats:italic>(LM) nonlinear regression method. A comparison of AP, GP and GP-LM as well as artificial neural network (ANN)-based models indicates that GP and GP-LM models exhibit superior reactivity ratio prediction accuracy and generalization performance (with correlation coefficient magnitudes close to or greater than 0.9) when compared with AP and ANN models. The GP-based reactivity ratio prediction models developed here due to their higher accuracy and generalization capability have the potential of replacing the widely used AP models.</jats:p>",

In nonpolar media, an increase of temperature favors incorporation of the less basic monomer whereas a more polar solvent has only a small effect and favors a more ideal copolymerization.

The selective hydrolysis of the ethyl ester monomer with trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr) gave a phosphonic acid monomer. The attempted bulk polymerizations of the monomers at 57\u201360 \u00b0C with 2,2\u2032\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were unsuccessful; however, the monomers were copolymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA) in bulk at 60 \u00b0C with AIBN. The resulting copolymers produced chars on burning, showing potential as flame\u2010retardant materials. Additionally, \u03b1\u2010(chloromethyl)acryloyl chloride (CMAC) was reacted with diethyl (hydroxymethyl)phosphonate to obtain a new monomer with identical ester and ether moieties. This monomer was hydrolyzed with TMSBr, homopolymerized, and copolymerized with MMA. The thermal stabilities of the copolymers increased with increasing amounts of the phosphonate monomer in the copolymers. A new route to highly reactive phosphorus\u2010containing acrylate monomers was developed. A new derivative of CMAC with mixed ester and ether groups was synthesized by substitution, first with diethyl (hydroxymethyl)phosphonate and then with sodium acetate. This monomer showed the highest reactivity and gave a crosslinked polymer. The incorporation of an ester group increased the rate of polymerization. The relative reactivities of the synthesized monomers in photopolymerizations were determined and compared with those of the other phosphorous\u2010containing acrylate monomers. Changing the monomer structure allowed control of the polymerization reactivity so that new phosphorus\u2010containing polymers with desirable properties could be obtained. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Fourier transform infrared and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR were used to characterize the structures and sulfonic acid contents of the copolymers. The copolymers were soluble in <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010pyrrolidinone, <jats:italic>N,N</jats:italic>\u2010dimethylacetamide, and <jats:italic>N,N</jats:italic>\u2010dimethylformamide and could form tough and flexible membranes. The protonated membranes were thermally stable up to 320 \u00b0C in air. The water uptake, hydrolytic and oxidative stability, and mechanical properties were evaluated. At 30\u201390 \u00b0C and 95% relative humidity, the proton conductivities of the membranes increased with the sulfonic acid content and temperature and almost reached that of Nafion 112. At 90\u2013130 \u00b0C, without external humidification, the conductivities increased with the temperature and benzoxazole content and reached above 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> S/cm. The SPAEKBO\u2010X membranes, especially those with high benzoxazole compositions, possessed a large amount of strongly bound water (&gt;50%). The experimental results indicate that SPAEKBO\u2010X copolymers are promising for proton\u2010exchange membranes in fuel cells, and their properties might be tailored by the adjustment of the copolymer composition for low temperatures and high humidity or for high temperatures and low humidity; they are especially promising for high\u2010temperature applications. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effect of solvents on the copolymerization of acrylamide and styrene has been studied. Copolymerization to low conversions were run in a variety of solvents which would affect the acrylamide monomer in different ways, i.e., by hydrogen bonding, by dipole\u2013dipole interaction only, or by a combination of both. The effect upon the acrylamide was measured by the shift in the infrared spectra of the amide carbonyl and N\uf8ffH groups. Essentially, both hydrogen bridging and dipole\u2013dipole interaction affect acrylamide in the same way, as manifested by a shift in the amide carbonyl and NH towards the longer wavelength. From the standpoint of acrylamide\u2013styrene copolymerization, the greater the shift in the NH absorption, the smaller is the amount of acrylamide that is found in the copolymer. Thus, by the proper choice of solvent, it is possible to obtain copolymers from the same monomer feed ranging in combined acrylamide from very low to very high, and reactivity ratios for acrylamide also ranging from very low to very high. Conversely, for styrene, activity ratios will range from high to low.</jats:p>",

This behavior makes it possible to apply the monomer reactivity ration theory, which was dervied for addition polymerizations, and from the use of the copolymer composition equation, the respective monomer reactivity ratios, the average and incremental copolymer compositions, and the monomer feed ratio at any conversion can be determined. A comparison of the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of \u03b3\u2010benzyl\u2010<jats:sc>L</jats:sc>\u2010glutamate NCA and <jats:sc>L</jats:sc>\u2010valine NCA in benzene/methylene chloride (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>G</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 2.1, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>V</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 0.6) with those obtained using dioxane (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>G</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 2.7, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>V</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 0.3) indicates that the interchain compositional heterogeneity is greater for copolymers prepared in the dioxane.

Once the reactivity ratios are obtained for any pair of \u03b1\u2010amino and <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010carboxyanhydrides, the use of the aforementioned parameters relating to interchain composition can give insight into the compositional heterogeneity between chains as a function of conversion and provide a basis for the preparation of random \u03b1\u2010amino acid copolymers that are homogeneous.</jats:p>",

At \u221278\u00b0C, <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>\u2010PhA preferentially polymerized to yield \u201cliving\u201d cyclopolymers, until an equilibrium concentration of <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>\u2010PhA monomer was reached. Then, styrene propagated from the living terminal rather slowly. The block structure of the copolymer was confirmed by the chemical and spectroscopic means. In the copolymerization at 0\u00b0C, the <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>\u2010PhA unit in copolymer consisted both of cyclized and uncyclized units. This copolymer seemed to contain short <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>\u2010PhA sequences. The variation of the <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>\u2010PhA\u2010St copolymer structure with the polymerization temperature was explained on the basis of whether the polymerization was carried out above or below the ceiling temperature (\u221243\u00b0C) of the homopolymerization of <jats:italic>o</jats:italic>\u2010PhA.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Amphiphilic block copolymers of 2,3,4,5,6\u2010pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are synthesized via nitroxide\u2010mediated polymerization (NMP). It is established that to obtain a controlled copolymerization a minimum of 40 mol% of PFS is required, which is significantly greater than other copolymerization systems such as using 4.5\u20138 mol% styrene or 1 mol% of 9\u2010(4\u2010vinylbenzyl)\u20109H\u2010carbazole to control the copolymerization of methacrylates. It is surmised that this lack of control is due to the reactivity ratios that favor the addition of MAA rather than PFS (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>PFS</jats:sub> = 0.14, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MAA</jats:sub> = 6.97). However this reactivity ratio pair suggests that a one\u2010shot delayed injection approach can be utilized to synthesize almost pure block copolymers in one pot. Therefore, poly(PFS)\u2010<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\u2010(PFS<jats:italic>\u2010ran\u2010</jats:italic>MAA) block copolymers are synthesized by a one\u2010shot delayed addition of MAA. While the concentration of irreversibly terminated chains is evident these results suggest a promising route to the synthesis of fluorinated amphiphilic block copolymers by NMP.\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mren201600052-abs-0001-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p>",

Synthesis of hyperbranched reactive macromolecules was carried out using complex\u2010radical cyclocopolymerization of donor\u2010acceptor type bifunctional monomers such as monoallyl ester of maleic acid (MAM), allyl acrylate (AA), allyl methacrylate (AM), allyl <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\u2010cinnamate (AC), methylallylmaleate (MeAM), methylallylfumarate (MAF) and allyl\u2010\u03b1\u2010(N\u2010maleimido)acetate (AMI), and maleic anhydride (MA) and styrene (St) as typical acceptor and donor comonomers, respectively. The kinetic parameters of these reactions, constants of cyclization, complex\u2010formation and copolymerization, as well as the ratios of chain growth rates for the participation of monomeric charge transfer complexes and free monomers, were all determined. It was demonstrated that in the studied systems, copolymerizations predominantly proceed according to alternating mechanism with formation of macromolecules having cyclolinear structure in the steady\u2010state and hyperbranched structure in the high conversion conditions. It was shown that formation of linear and hyperbranched macromolecules containing allyl or vinylene groups in the side chain occurs selectively carry out and depends on the nature of used comonomer. General schemes and proposed mechanism of hyperbranching and crosslinking reactions were also described.

The efficiency of the aluminum components in the latter catalyst systems appear to decrease in the following order: AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &gt; Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Et<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Cl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> \u226b AlEt<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cl(\u226bAlCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). The alkylaluminum halides could also be used effectually in the form of the complex with acrylonitrile. The catalytic activity was markedly affected by the order of mixing of the catalyst components and the monomers. Effective catalysts could be prepared only when the catalyst components were mixed in the presence of acrylonitrile. The catalyst activity was also found to depend upon the Al/V ratio, reaching its maximum when the ratio was about 20 in the AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\u00b7AN/VO(O<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010Bu)<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> system. Other combinations of conjugated diene with conjugated polar vinyl monomer were similarly copolymerized by these catalysts. It was found that different feed ratios between the diene and the vinyl monomer which were varied over a wide range always resulted in the formation of a 1:1 copolymer. The butadiene\u2010acrylonitrile copolymer thus formed gave an NMR spectrum in which there was only one peak assignable to the methylene protons (7.72 \u03c4) of the butadiene unit. On the basis of these findings, it may be suggested that alternating copolymerization prevails in the polymerization systems here investigated.</jats:p>",

In this paper the kinetics of ethylene\u2013propylene copolymerization in the presence of catalysts prepared from trialkylaluminum and vanadium tetrachloride is studied. Having adopted the conditions leading to the formation of catalysts having an activity independent of time, we were able to determine that the copolymerization rate is first order with respect to the catalyst concentration and to the sum of the concentrations of the two monomers. With the total concentration of the monomers constant, the copolymerization rate increases very rapidly as the ethylene concentration increases. The activation energies of the four chain growth reactions of the copolymerization proved to be practically equal.</jats:p>",

All reactions were monitored online, by an Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization (ACOMP) system. The concentrations of the two comonomers in their monomeric form, as well as their concentrations incorporated into polymer, were obtained from the monitored data. It was seen that Aam homopolymerization was faster than VB and both homopolymerization rates were higher than copolymerization rates at any combination. In the reactions with 1.5%, 5% and 10% (mol) VB, VB was completely depleted and further reaction was Aam homopolymerization. In the copolymerizations with 5 to 50% initial VB content, the plots of VB fraction in the remaining monomer mixture versus conversion exhibited a corner at 10\u201330% conversion. This corner showed that the behavior of the reaction changed abruptly at this point. In the first stage of the reactions, the composition was seen to be almost constant with almost no composition drift whereas in the second part, the VB fraction decreased monotonically. Monomer reactivity ratios (MRR) were calculated by error in variables (EVM) method. Since the reactions gave two distinguishable regions, the reaction part before and after the corner were evaluated separately. Therefore, the monomer reactivity ratios were found as <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>Aam</jats:italic></jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>VB</jats:italic></jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21 for the part before and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>Aam</jats:italic></jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>VB</jats:italic></jats:sub>\u2009=\u20099.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 for the part after the corner.</jats:p>",

The experimental data on the effect of comonomer concentration on <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>w</jats:sub> of polymers were used to calculate the ratios between the effective rate constants of chain transfer with monomer and the propagation rate constant. It was shown that the effective rate constant of chain transfer with monomers increases in the row of monomers: ethylene &lt; 1\u2010hexene &lt; propylene. Meanwhile, the data on the effect of copolymers on content of terminal double bonds of various types demonstrate that different reactions of chain transfer with comonomer may simultaneously occur during copolymerization. It results in simultaneous formation of terminal vinylidene and <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\u2010vinylene bonds. Therefore, the calculated rate constants of chain transfer with comonomer are complex values, which include the rate constants of chain transfer with comonomer occurring via different mechanisms. The data on MWD, short chain branching (SCB) and terminal double bonds content of different types were obtained by molecular weight fractionation of copolymers followed by the analysis of narrow fractions. The analysis of the data on MWDs of SCB and terminal double bonds shows that active sites of the TMC are considerably heterogeneous with respect to the rates of different chain transfer reactions with monomers. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The presence of oxygen in the system not only caused an induction period but also decreased the average particle size (<jats:italic>D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub></jats:italic>). However increasing AA concentration ([AA]) gave a reduction in the induction period. The FTIR and NMR analysis of the latex copolymer confirmed that the correlation of the copolymer compositions with the feed compositions was much better at the lower [AA] than at the higher levels. The AA contents of the copolymers obtained in air were much lower than those of the copolymers obtained under N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> protection. Decreasing [AA] led to decrease in the copolymer molecular weight and broadening of the molecular weight distribution, but the particle size distribution (\u03b4/<jats:italic>D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub></jats:italic>) was unaffected. In addition, the average particle diameter (<jats:italic>D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub></jats:italic>) was proportional to [AA]<jats:sup>\u20130.255</jats:sup>, and increasing comonomers feed content caused linear increase of <jats:italic>D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub></jats:italic>, and a monodisperse sample with final solids contents up to 34.2 wt % was obtained. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

No reasonable copolymerization of glycolide and \u03b2hyphen;propiolactone was obtained at 20\u00b0C in nitrobenzene, whereas all catalysts yielded copolyesters at 100\u00b0C. In the case of glycolide/\u03b3\u2010butyrolactone only bulk copolymerizations at 60\u00b0C with acidic initiators were successful. Under other conditions only homopolymerization of glycolide was observed. Copolymerizations of glycolide and \u03b3\u2010valerolactone were performed in bulk and in nitrobenzene with both acidic and complexing initiators, whereas anionic initiators only caused homopolymerization of glycolide. Acidic initiators favored the incorporation of \u03b4\u2010valerolactone, whereas the complexing initiators favored the incorporation of glycolide. The crystallinity of the glycolide/\u03b4\u2010valerolactone copolymers was characterized by means of differential scanning calorimetry, and a good agreement with the expectations from both molar composition and sequence distribution was found.</jats:p>",

The monomers reactivity ratios were calculated by extended Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f6s and Mao\u2013Huglin methods. The average reactivity ratios and Alfrey\u2013Price Q and e Values were found to be r1 = 0.028, r2 = 0.347, Q1 = 0.035, e1 = 1.013 for CPMI/NVP system and r1 = 0.044, r2 = 0.060, Q1 = 0.145, e1 = 1.297 for the FCPMI/NVP system. The distribution of monomer sequences along the copolymer chain was calculated using a statistical method based on the obtained reactivity ratios. The thermal properties of the resulting copolymers were also investigated. These copolymers exhibit fairly high thermal stability with decomposition temperatures above 230\u00b0 C. The effect of the N-substituents on the radical copolymerization of the above functional maleimides with NVP is discussed. </jats:p>",

Kinetics of the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) (co)polymerization of styrene (St) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEO5MEMA) was studied by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 1H NMR spectroscopy, which allows calculating not only (co)polymerization parameters but also gives valuable information on RAFT (co)polymerization kinetics, process control, and chain propagation. Molecular weight Mn and dispersity \u0110 of the copolymers were determined by SEC with triple detection. The detailed investigation of styrene and PEO5MEMA (co)polymerization showed that both monomers prefer cross-polymerization due to their low reactivity ratios (r1 &lt; 1, r2 &lt; 1); therefore, the distribution of monomeric units across the copolymer chain of p(St-co-PEO5MEMA) with various compositions is almost ideally statistical or azeotropic. The thermoresponsive properties of p(St-co-PEO5MEMA) copolymers in aqueous solutions as a function of different hydrophilic/hydrophobic substituent ratios were evaluated by measuring the changes in hydrodynamic parameters under applied temperature using the dynamic light scattering method (DLS).</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Reactivity ratio estimation is a non\u2010linear estimation problem. Typically, reactivity ratios are estimated using the instantaneous copolymer composition equation, otherwise known as the Mayo\u2010Lewis model, based on low conversion (&lt;5%) copolymer composition data. However, there are other instantaneous models, which can be used to estimate reactivity ratios, such as the instantaneous triad fraction equations. The aim of this paper is to determine the potential improvement in reactivity ratio estimates when triad fraction data is used in place of and in combination with copolymer composition data. The interest in using triad fraction data in parameter estimation, stems from the fact that there are a greater number of responses measured (six triad fractions) compared to composition leading to data with theoretically more information content. In principle this should lead to reactivity ratio estimates having less uncertainty. In this study, the parameter estimates are obtained by employing the error in variables model (EVM), assuming a multiplicative error structure. Several case studies involving published literature data for different copolymer systems are presented. As the case studies demonstrate in general more precise estimates can be obtained from triad fraction data. Combining the triad fraction with composition data leads to little additional improvement. However, discrepancies arise between reactivity ratios estimated from composition data compared with those obtained from triad fraction data depending upon the copolymer system. Those copolymer systems exhibiting more heterogeneity due to phase separation during polymerization may be showing more discrepancy.</jats:p>",

Testing includes Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis (CHNS). The copolymer composition was determined by elemental analysis, and the reactivity ratios of monomers were calculated through linearization methods such as Fineman\u2013Ross (FR), inverted Fineman\u2013Ross (IFR), Kelen\u2013Tudos (KT) and Mayo\u2013Lewis (ML).

Hydrogel copolymers exhibited good thermal stability, and SEM showed three-dimensional porous structures. Antibiotic-free and antibiotic-loaded hydrogels demonstrated antimicrobial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As the ratio of DMA in hydrogel copolymer increased, the activity of copolymer against bacteria enhanced. The results indicated that these hydrogels have the potential to be used as antibacterial materials.</jats:p>",

The thermal properties were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The influence of the reaction conditions, including comonomer ratios, reaction time, and polymerization temperature, on the molecular weight and degree of branching (DB) of the resulting copolymers were investigated in detail. With increasing ratios of styrene in total monomers from 10 to 90%, the resulting copolymers have number\u2010average molecular weights that change from 6.0 to 10.5\u2009kDa, polydispersities from 2.96 to 4.74, and a degree of branching from 0.01 to 0.45. The experimental results indicated that the structures and properties can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We investigated the kinetics of the oxidative chemical copolymerization of 2\u2010methoxyaniline (OMA) and 3\u2010aminobenzenesulfonic acid (MA) by monitoring monomer depletion with <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy. We adapted a semiempirical kinetic model, previously used for OMA homopolymerization, for the consumption of both OMA and MA monomers with a large difference in their reactivities. The OMA polymerization rate and end conversion showed a similar dependence on the reaction conditions, as described in the first part of this series, for its homopolymerization. Generally, the MA comonomer had an inhibition effect on the OMA polymerization rate. However, an increase in the initial MA concentration resulted in an increased OMA initiation rate. Because of the higher reactivity of OMA compared with that of MA, the OMA conversion began before the MA conversion, and both the initiation and propagation rates were higher than those for MA. The molar ratios of the converted monomers (MA/OMA) were always significantly lower than the corresponding MA/OMA feed fractions. They depended on the reaction conditions used for the copolymerization. In particular, higher oxidant or MA concentrations, higher temperatures, and a 1 M DCl concentration favored MA conversion, that is, its insertion into the copolymer. The MA end conversion was much smaller than that of OMA, only up to 23%; for a low oxidant concentration (oxidant/monomer\u2010deficient molar ratio), it was only 6%. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

The amount of cerium (IV) affected the polymerization most strikingly, and grafting percentages showed maxima with suitable amounts of initiator for both the monomers. As a solvent water proved to be superior to aqueous nitric acid except the reaction with a small amount of initiator. Under appropriate conditions, around 240 and 200% grafting percentages were achieved for acrylamide and acrylic acid, respectively.

The purpose of this paper is to study methods for estimating copolymerization reactivity ratios based on the differential composition equation. Methodology. Most estimation methods reduce the differential composition equation to a linear form. They are based on the least squares method and do not take into account the measurement error in the input variable. Therefore they lead to statistically incorrect results. When analyzing the problem on the basis of the error-in-variables model in the classical case, additional information is required to determine the magnitude of the errors in measuring the concentration of monomers in the mixture and in the copolymer. Inclusion of the measurement error in the input variable into the model as the Berkson error is more consistent with the actual conditions of the experiments. It allows simultaneous estimating both the reactivity ratios and the variances of measurement errors using the maximum likelihood method. Results. The algorithm have been developed for estimating reactivity ratios with no additional information. The empirical study of estimation methods has been carried out using the example of copolymerization of vinyl esters. Findings. It is shown that the method based on symmetric equations gives incorrect results. Estimation results using the proposed algorithm are closest to the estimates obtained by the nonlinear least squares method</jats:p>",

Due to the isolation of the COOH and COOR groups from the benzene ring owing of the CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> group the electron densities on the polymerizable CC double bonds of these acids, their H\u2010dimers, the H\u2010associates with the solvent and their alkyl esters are identical.

The preferential enrichment of the copolymer with the acid is explained through a bimolecular addition of the first C\uf8feC of the H\u2010dimer to the polymeric radical and a faster \u201cmonomolecular\u201d addition of the C\uf8feC of the second dimer acid unit associated with the polymeric radical. If however, there is some steric hindrance to an immediate radical propagation between the C\uf8feC of two acid units joined by H\u2010bonds between the carboxyl groups, several elementary acts of bimolecular addition of the other comonomer molecules may take place between the addition of the first and the second dimer acid unit.</jats:p>",

Despite extensive partitioning of PEGMA into the water phase, copolymers containing up to 24 mol % PEGMA were formed in the oil phase, from comonomer feeds containing 30 mol % PEGMA. Conversions by suspension polymerization were comparable to those obtained by solution polymerization, at over 70%. Suspension copolymers with high PEGMA contents contained high\u2010molecular\u2010weight polymer formed by uncontrolled polymerization, unless poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was added to displace the growing polymer from the interface. The addition of diethylene glycol dimethacrylate gave capsules at 17 mol % PEGMA with ATRP, whereas conventional free\u2010radical polymerization required 24 mol % PEGMA to form capsules. The lower PEGMA level required for capsule formation with ATRP was attributed to the lower rates of propagation and crosslinking and to improved incorporation of PEGMA into the final gels. Suspension ATRP with 24 mol % PEGMA in the feed gave two\u2010layer capsule walls consisting of an inner layer visible by transmission electron microscopy and an outer layer visible by both transmission electron microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy, which indicated a compositional gradient across the capsule wall. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The copolymerization rate is below the rate of TFE homopolymerization and the copolymerization kinetics depends on the FVE content in the reaction medium. The copolymer composition is very similar if the FVE content in monomer mixture is \u22642.5 mol %. However, the percent amount of FVE in the copolymer, the copolymerization rate, and molecular mass of synthesized copolymers decrease noticeably with increase in the FVE content in the monomer mixture. The constants of copolymerization are <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>= 2.8 (TFE) and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.03 (FVE). The copolymer is a statistical polymer consisting of TFE blocks and individual FVE molecules between the blocks. The average molecular mass of copolymers is significantly less than that of the TFE homopolymer (PTFE) synthesized at the same conditions. The morphologies of PTFE and copolymer powders were investigated by thermomechanical analysis and are not similar. The copolymer has a completely amorphous diblock morphology depending on the FVE content. The introduction of FVE molecules into the copolymer macromolecules is accompanied by reduction of the crystalline portion of copolymer. If the FVE content in copolymer is \u22653.5 mol %, the copolymer macromolecules completely lose the ability to form crystalline portions as a result of their amorphicity. The introduction of up to 2.4 mol % FVE into the copolymer macromolecules yields a highly thermostable and meltable copolymer which can be processed by using the industrial processes used widely for thermoplastics. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010BDFE) copolymers of various aspects (from white powders to yellow viscous liquids) were produced depending on the copolymer compositions. The microstructures of the obtained copolymers were characterized by <jats:sup>19</jats:sup>F and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy and by elementary analysis and these techniques enabled one to assess the contents of both comonomers in the produced copolymers. VDF was shown to be more incorporated in the copolymer than BDFE. From the extended Kelen and Tudos method, the kinetics of the radical copolymerization led to the determination of the reactivity ratios, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, of both comonomers (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>VDF</jats:sub> = 1.20 \u00b1 0.50 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>BDFE =</jats:sub> 0.40 \u00b1 0.15 at 75 \u00b0C) showing that VDF is more reactive than BDFE. Alfrey\u2010Price's Q and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> values of BDFE monomer were calculated to be 0.009 (from <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>VDF</jats:sub> = 0.008) or 0.019 (from <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub>VDF</jats:sub> = 0.015) and +1.22 (vs. <jats:italic>e</jats:italic><jats:sub>VDF</jats:sub> = 0.40) or +1.37 (vs. <jats:italic>e</jats:italic><jats:sub>VDF</jats:sub> = 0.50), respectively, indicating that BDFE is an electron\u2010accepting monomer. Statistic cooligomers were produced with molar masses ranging from 1,800 to 5,500 g/mol (assessed by GPC with polystyrene standards). A further evidence of the successful copolymerization was shown by the selective reduction of bromine atoms in poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010BDFE) cooligomers that led to analog PVDF. The thermal properties of the poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010BDFE) cooligomers were also determined and those containing a high VDF amount exhibited a high thermal stability. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Compositional (chemical) heterogeneity of the polymer particles is also influenced by different affinity of the polymer (copolymer) to the water and oil phases. Structurally inhomogeneous polymer product results from the simultaneously proceeding polymerization in the water and oil phases. The polymer product represents a mixture of homopolymer (copolymer) formed in the water phase and of the copolymer (sometimes graft copolymer) formed on the surface of the polymer particles or in the interphase surrounding the polymer particle.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A novel copolymer of vinylidene cyanide (VCN) and 2,2,2\u2010trifluoroethyl methacrylate (MATRIF) was synthesized by bulk free radical process in a 52% yield from an equimolar comonomer feed. The copolymer's composition and microstructure were analyzed by FTIR, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010 and <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C\u2010NMR spectroscopy, SEC, and elemental analysis. The reactivity ratios calculated from both the Q\u2010e Alfrey\u2010Price parameters and the Jenkins' Patterns Scheme indicate a tendency to alternation in the copolymerization, the latter method suggesting that MATRIF homopropagation be slightly favoured (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>V</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>12</jats:sub> = 0.1, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>M</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>21</jats:sub> = 0.3). The molar incorporation of VCN in the copolymer was only 42 mol % according to the 9.0 wt % nitrogen content determined by elemental analysis, in good agreement with the value obtained by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR. High\u2010resolution <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C\u2010NMR spectra were used to study the microstructure of the copolymer. As an example, the three well\u2010resolved carbonyl resonances in the <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C\u2010NMR spectrum were assigned to the MATRIF\u2010centered triads VMV, VMM, and MMM, respectively, (V and M stand for VCN and MATRIF, respectively). The presence of VCN dyads (e.g., in VVM and VVV sequences) was shown to be marginal or absent altogether. Thermogravimetric analysis of poly(VCN\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010MATRIF) copolymer showed good thermal stability, and its main pyrolytic degradation taking place only above 368 \u00b0C. A 4% weight loss at about 222 \u00b0C suggested the presence of a few VCN homodyads, possibly inducing thermal depolymerization. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A series of these copolymers with various sulfonate loads were synthesized using the emulsion polymerization technique with a study of the copolymerization kinetics, monomer reactivity ratio and copolymer properties.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> The copolymerization kinetics are significantly enhanced with an increase of NaSS feed in the polymerization.

The colloidal particle size of the copolymers depends upon the NaSS composition. The thermal stability of the copolymers is greatly enhanced with higher NaSS content in the copolymer backbone. Higher glass transition temperatures are observed for the copolymers with higher NaSS content.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> The reactivity ratio values suggest that styrene prefers to form copolymers whereas NaSS produces homopolymers. It is also found that styrene copolymerization with NaSS is only twice as fast as homopolymerization. In contrast, NaSS homopolymerization is ten times faster than NaSS copolymerization with styrene. The NaSS content in the copolymer backbone affects the thermal stability and the glass transition of the copolymers. Copyright \u00a9 2008 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

The results of homopolymerization show that yields and the degree of polymerization depend on the purity of the monomers, method of polymerization, and the initiator used. With the exception of monomers containing \u03b2\u2010chloroethoxy group attached to the phosphorus atom, polymers obtained from the dialkyl vinyl phosphates had higher molecular weights than the corresponding dialkyl vinyl phosphonates. Dialkyl isopropenyl phosphates polymerized less readily than the dialkyl vinyl phosphates and diethyl styryl phosphate did not polymerize at all. An attempt is made to explain these results in terms of steric hindrance, charge distribution, and chain transfer. Examination of the copolymerization products, with a number of techniques used, indicates that these consist of polymers with a wide range of compositions and molecular weights. The copolymers with methyl methacrylate appear to consist of a large block of poly(methyl methacrylate) at one end and a smaller block of polymer formed from the vinyl phosphate or phosphonate at the other. Similar conclusions are drawn about copolymers involving styrene. It is likely that the monomer units in copolymers with vinyl acetate are randomly distributed.</jats:p>",

The relative intensities of three peaks of the splitting signal for the methoxy protons in the nonalternating copolymers obtained by the use of benzoyl peroxide in the absence of metal halides agree well with the cotacticity distribution calculated theoretically by the Lewis\u2010Mayo mechanism with the stereoregulation following Bernoullian statistics. The splitting signals in the <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010 and <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C\u2010NMR spectra of the alternating copolymers prepared in the presence of metal halides cannot be explained by the same mechanism. The relative intensities of three peaks of the splitting signals for the methoxy protons and for the carbonyl carbon in the methyl methacrylate unit (the contents of cotactic triads centered by the methyl methacrylate unit) are not equal to those for the aromatic C<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> carbon in the styrene unit (the contents of cotactic triads centered by styrene unit). The value of <jats:italic>f</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup><jats:italic>Y</jats:italic> \u2010 4<jats:italic>fxfz</jats:italic> is not equal to zero, where <jats:italic>fx, fy</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>fz</jats:italic> are the cosyndiotactic, coheterotactic, and coisotactic triad contents, respectively, in the alternating copolymer. Copolymers obtained in the presence of zinc chloride are not exactly equimolar alternating but always contain a methyl methacrylate unit in excess, and the relative intensities of the three peaks for the aromatic C<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> carbon change with the copolymer composition. These results are explained by a proposed mechanism: the alternating copolymerization proceeds through the homopolymerization of a ternary molecular complex composed of a metal halide, methyl methacrylate, and styrene, accompanied with the stereoregulation following first\u2010order Markovian statistics; the increase of methyl methacrylate content in the copolymer prepared in the presence of zinc chloride is caused by the participation of the binary molecular complex composed of a metal halide and methyl methacrylate in addition to the ternary molecular complex.</jats:p>",

The nine samples had comonomer contents of 0\u20134.2 mol % 1\u2010hexene with a narrow range of molecular weights (34,000\u201339,000 g/mol). Because all the copolymer samples had narrow, unimodal chemical composition distributions, they were ideal as calibration standards for CRYSTAF. A linear calibration curve was constructed relating the peak crystallization temperature from CRYSTAF operated at a cooling rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/min and the comonomer content as determined by <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR. Reactivity ratios for ethylene and 1\u2010hexene were estimated by the fitting of reactant liquid\u2010phase compositional data to the Mayo\u2013Lewis equation. It was found that a value of the 1\u2010hexene reactivity ratio could not be unequivocally determined from the set of samples analyzed because the range of comonomer incorporation was too narrow. Stockmayer's bivariate distribution was used to model the fractionation process in CRYSTAF, and although a good fit to experimental CRYSTAF profiles was attained, the model did not fully describe the underlying crystallization phenomena. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effect of conjugation on the reactivity of perfluorinated diolefins has been little investigated. A characteristic representative of this class of compounds is hexafluorobutadiene, the activity of which in polymerization reactions is much less than that of tetrafluoroethylene. There is an inadequacy of published data on the polymerization of hexafluorobutadiene. We have investigated the conditions for the polymerization of this compound and have found that it takes place only in emulsions in the presence of a cationactive emulsifier in acid medium (pH 1\u20133) in the presence of a radical type of initiator. The effect of the basic parameters on the emulsion polymerization was investigated. The hexafluorobutadiene polymer obtained in emulsion, in contrast to the polytetrafluoroethylene, is characterized by a low melting point and little stability. It is insoluble in most organic solvents. To ascertain the relative activity of hexafluorobutadiene as compared with other dienic compounds a study was made of copolymerization with chloroprene, fluoroprene, and isoprene, both in emulsion and in solution, and the reactivity constants were determined. The monomer reactivity ratios of the systems are as follows. Chloroprene\u2010hexaflurobutadiene: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.1; fluoroprene\u2010hexafluorobutadiene: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 2.93, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.24; isoprene\u2010hexafluorobutadiene: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 1.19, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.78. On the basis of the monomer reactivity ratios in the monomer\u2010hexafluorobutadiene systems and of reported data on the ratios for chloroprene\u2010fluoroprene and isoprene\u2010fluoroprene copolymerization, the relative reactivity of the monomers was calculated with respect to a common radical, the relative reactivity constant of the radical and its monomer being taken as unity. Chloroprene is 10 times more active than hexafluorobutadiene with respect to the radical of the latter; it is 8 times as reactive as isoprene and 2.4 times as reactive as fluoroprene. The results are in conformity with data on the separate polymerization of the monomers in emulsion. The considerable fall in activity of hexafluorobutadiene in polymerization and copolymerization reactions can probably be interpreted by localization of \u03c0\u2010electrons at the double\u2010bonded carbon atoms and weakening of the conjugation effect owing to a shift in electron density to the highly polar fluorine atom. Similar effects were observed for hexafluorobutadiene in diene synthesis.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The free radical copolymerization of electron-acceptor and electron-donor vinyl monomers represents a particular case of sequence-controlled polymerization. The reactions of maleic anhydride (MA) or related compounds (acceptor comonomers) with \u03b1-olefins (donor comonomers) result in the formation of the alternating copolymers that have clear prospects for petrochemical and biomedical applications. However, in contrast to the well-established polymerization of acrylate monomers, these processes have not been studied theoretically using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In our research, we performed a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the free radical copolymerization of MA and closely related maleimide with different structural types of olefins at mpw1pw91/6-311g(d) level of the DFT. The results of our calculations clearly indicated the preference of the alternating reaction mode for the copolymerization of MA with \u03b1-olefins, isobutylene and prospective unsaturated monomers, as well as methylenealkanes. The DFT modeling of the thermally induced Alder-ene reaction between MA and olefins allowed to exclude this reaction from the scope of possible side processes at moderately high temperatures. Comparative analysis of MA and N-methylmaleimide (MMI) reactivity shown that the use of MMI instead of MA makes no sense in terms of the reaction rate and selectivity.</jats:p>",

The unsaturation in nadic anhydride exhibited good copolymerizability despite the fact that the double bond is isolated and allylic in nature. The usual retardation by the allylic protons was not significantly felt in this case, as the allylic protons were located at a bridge head posing geometric restrictions for stabilization of the allylic free radicals. However, an increase in concentration of NA in the feed decreased the overall rate of copolymerization. Based on the reactivity ratio, the probability for formation of sequences of NA in its copolymer with styrene was computed for a few compositions.</jats:p>",

Varying the AUNa concentration, stable particles bearing only carboxylic charges have been produced with diameters ranging from 200 to 500 nm at solids content as high as 40%. However a low AUNa yield at the particle surface has been found (30\u201335%), which could be explained by very unfavorable reactivity ratios of AUNa with S and BuA. Most of the AUNa seems to be wasted in the water phase (unpolymerized and forming hydrosoluble chains). Furthermore, a concentration of AUNa higher than 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> results in the latex destabilization, presumably caused by the formation of a large amount of polyelectrolytes. Kinetic studies of the AUNa consumption show that the AUNa is mainly fixed at the particle surface between 90 and 100% conversion, which indicates that the AUNa is mainly polymerized in the water phase and not at the particle surface. An attempt has been made to increase the surface charge density by polymerizing a shell of AUNa/S/BuA on a seed latex. It turned out to be unsuccessful (low surface yield, formation of new particles).</jats:p>",

The heat of copolymerization decreased almost linearly with the increase in diethyl fumarate content in the copolymer. The heat of homopolymerization for diethyl fumarate was equal to 15.5 \u00b1 0.3 kcal/mole. Monomer reactivity ratios at 100\u00b0C were also determined. The rate of copolymerization was followed over the whole range of conversion. A gel effect was noticed in copolymerizations at lower but not at higher temperatures. The initial rate of copolymerization exhibited a maximum at an intermediate monomer feed composition, differing from the previously reported tendency. The difference was found to be due to the method used for determining the rate of copolymerization, and the superiority of the DSC method was proved. The mechanism of the radical\u2010radical termination process was discussed. From the viewpoint of chemically controlled termination, the cross\u2010termination factor \u03d5 was estimated to be 2.0, which is reasonable considering the steric hindrance; assumption of the predominance of a diffusion\u2010controlled termination reaction was also consistent with the results.</jats:p>",

Vital clues regarding the development and the structure of the network were obtained from the study of copolymerization kinetics of styrene/VE systems. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to obtain the individual fraction conversion rates of both the monomers. The conversion versus time data for both styrene and VE was fit to an autocatalytic kinetic model. The autocatalytic model was found to adequately replicate the kinetic data over the entire life of cure. In this investigation, the effects of styrene concentration, temperature, catalyst concentration, and initiator concentration on cure kinetics of styrene/VE systems were studied. The conversion profiles of both styrene and VE were used to obtain the reactivity ratios of the two monomers. The reactivity ratios were evaluated to be close to zero, suggesting that initially alternating copolymerization is favored over homopolymerization. The cure behavior of vinyl\u2010ester resins is affected not only by the chemical reactivity of the monomers toward the free radicals, but also by diffusion effects, phase separation, and microgel formation. The interplay of these factors controls the kinetics of cure, thereby affecting the physical and chemical properties of the resulting polymer.</jats:p>",

Both freshly prepared catalyst and catalyst which had been aged up to 114 hr. were used. When the catalyst was aged prior to adding the monomer, the yields were lower and the products had higher molecular weights. In the case of copolymers, aging of the catalyst also affected the relative concentrations of the comonomers in the products. 1\u2010Butene was an effective chain transfer agent under all reaction conditions. The data were found to be consistent with the previously suggested mechanism according to which different species initiate polymerizations with freshly mixed and aged catalysts.</jats:p>",

Kinetics studies of the copolymerization of the fluoroalkenes copolymers were monitored by GPC and 19F NMR with molar masses up to 12,200 g/mol and dispersities (\u0110) ranging from 1.33 to 1.47. Such an OMRcP behaves as a controlled copolymerization, evidenced by the molar mass of the resulting copolymer-monomer conversion linear relationship. The reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers were determined by using the Fineman-Ross and Kelen-T\u00fcdos fitting model leading to rVDF = 0.384 \u00b1 0.013 and r1234yf = 2.147 \u00b1 0.129 at 60 \u00b0C, showing that a lower reactivity of VDF integrated in the copolymer to a greater extent leads to the production of gradient or pseudo-diblock copolymers.

While it is widely recognized that polyelectrolyte synthesis is impacted by the pre\u2010polymer formulation and polymerization conditions, the specific relationships between these factors and the subsequent polymer properties are not well understood. Therefore, the current work intends to improve understanding of ionic strength (IS) effects during the copolymerization of 2\u2010acrylamido\u20102\u2010methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) and acrylamide (AAm). The aims of the study are i) to use in situ H<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> NMR to study copolymerization kinetics, and ii) to determine how increasing IS impacts copolymerization kinetics (and, by extension copolymer microstructure). It is found that altering IS prior to copolymerization has significant impacts on the reactivity ratios, and therefore impacts the microstructure through multiple mechanisms. Increasing IS causes a crowding effect, where the propagating chain develops a random coil conformation and causes steric hindrance of the large AMPS monomer, decreasing the likelihood of AMPS propagation. When the IS is increased further, the ionic shielding effect is more impactful, increasing the likelihood of AMPS propagation. Ultimately, this work will make it possible to manipulate IS to synthesize AMPS/AAm copolymers with specific desirable properties for target applications.</jats:p>",

Methylaluminoxane (MAO) was used as cocatalyst. The activity of the catalyst was higher in copolymerization of ethylene and propylene (EPR) rather than in terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene and diene monomers. The effects of [Al] : [Zr] molar ratio, polymerization temperature, pressure ratio of ethylene/propylene and the ENB concentration on the terpolymerization behavior were studied. The highest productivity of the catalyst was obtained at 60\u00b0C, [Al] : [Zr] molar ratios of 750 : 1 and 500 : 1 for copolymerization and terpolymerization, respectively. Increasing the molar ratio of [Al] : [Zr] up to 500 : 1 increased the ethylene and ENB contents of the terpolymers, while beyond this ratio the productivity of the catalyst dropped, leading to lower ethylene and ENB contents. Terpolymerization was carried out batchwise at temperatures from 40 to 70\u00b0C. Rate time profiles of the polymerization were a decay type for both copolymerization and terpolymerization. Glass transition temperatures (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>g</jats:italic></jats:sub>) of the obtained terpolymers were between \u221264 and \u221252\u00b0C. Glass transition temperatures of both copolymers and terpolymers were decreased with increased ethylene content of the polymers. Dynamic mechanical and rheological properties of the obtained polymers were studied. A compounded EPDM showed good thermal stability with time. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To probe the sensitivity of the copolymerization to the catalyst structure, a series of CuBBIM catalysts with various steric, electronic, and geometric ligand characteristics was prepared, including CuBBIMs having benzimidazole ring substituents and ligand backbones of various lengths. Four different acrylates were also evaluated as comonomers (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010butyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010butyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate).

Copolymers prepared with <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010butyl methacrylate comonomer exhibited the highest ethylene contents (31\u201363%), whereas those prepared with methyl acrylate contained only minor amounts of ethylene (&lt;15%).

It was found that the copolymer composition produced in the suspension polymerization of acrylonitrile and styrene was significantly different from that in the bulk polymerization at the same monomer feed ratio, since acrylonitrile is partially soluble in water. To predict accurately and then control the copolymer composition in the suspension polymerization, a model to calculate the copolymer composition was proposed based on considering the phase partition of actylonitrile between monomer and aqueous phases. The results calculated by the model are in agreement with the experimental data. The real reactivity ratios in monomer phase used in the model are the same as that in the bulk polymerization, but the apparent reactivity ratios used in the classical theory for the suspension polymerization vary significantly with water/oil ratio. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The large differences in reactivity of SAS may be attributed to the different electron distributions in SAS in each solvent which are caused by the poor solvating power of dimethyl sulfoxide and by the addition of protons. In copolymerization in aqueous solution, the physical condition depends upon the content of SAS in the monomer feed, and SAS is copolymerized to only a small extent in the range of heterogeneous systems, whereas SAS is copolymerized rather well in the range of homogeneous systems. Homopolymerization of SAS shows a first\u2010order dependence on initiator concentration and a three\u2010halves\u2010order dependence on monomer concentration; this is attributed to degradative chain transfer of SAS. Rates of copolymerization of AN and SAS decrease with increasing SAS content.</jats:p>",

This article deals with the graft copolymerization of acrylonitrile onto <jats:italic>Agave americana</jats:italic> fibers in air in the presence of ceric ammonium nitrate as a redox initiator. A maximum percentage grafting of 24% was obtained after the optimization of various reaction parameters, including the reaction time, temperature, and concentrations of nitric acid, initiator, and monomer. The graft copolymers obtained under the optimum conditions were then subjected to the evaluation of different physicochemical properties, including swelling behavior in different solvents, moisture absorption behavior under different humidity levels, and chemical resistance. The graft copolymers were further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis), and X\u2010ray diffraction techniques. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Confidence contours in parameter space are a helpful tool to compare and classify determined estimators. For more intricate parameter estimations of nonlinear nature or complex error structures, the procedure of determining confidence contours is a statistically complex task. For polymer chemists, such particular cases are encountered in determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization. Hereby, determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization requires nonlinear parameter estimation. Additionally, data may possess (possibly correlated) errors in both dependent and independent variables. A common approach for such nonlinear estimations is the error\u2010in\u2010variables model yielding statistically unbiased estimators. Regarding reactivity ratios, to date published procedures neglect the non\u2010Gaussian structure of the error estimates that is a consequence of the nonlinearity of the model. In this publication, this issue is addressed by employing a Bayesian hierarchical model, which correctly propagates the errors of all variables. The statistical procedure is discussed in chemist friendly language to encourage confident usage of the tool. The approach is based on a <jats:styled-content>Python</jats:styled-content> program requiring minimal installation effort. A detailed manual of the code is included in the appendix\u00a0of this work, in an effort to make this procedure available to all interested polymer\u00a0chemists.</jats:p>",

Crucial in this study is sequence analysis by MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS for resultant copolymers that was obtained via ruthenium\u2010catalyzed living radical copolymerization with a malonate\u2010based alkyl halide initiator showing selective initiation ability. The copolymers of a simple <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010alkyl maleimide [e.g., <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010ethyl maleimide (EMI)] with styrene gave complicated peak patterns for the MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS spectra indicating low degree of alternating sequence, in contrary to expectation from the reactivity ratios (almost zero). A simple substitution of methyl group (CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) of EMI with trifluoromethyl (CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>: CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\u2010MI) made the peak patterns much simpler giving the copolymer with higher alternating sequence. More interestingly, the peak interval of the copolymer at earlier polymerization stage was equal to sum of the molecular weights of CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\u2010MI and styrene, suggesting possibility of the pair propagation of the monomers. Indeed, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR analyses of the mixture of maleimide with styrene suggested stronger interaction of CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\u2010MI than EMI. Based on the results, maleimide derivatives carrying a substituent\u2010designable electron\u2010withdrawing group [ROC(\uf8feO)N\u2013: R = substituent] were newly designed toward incorporation of functional side chains.

Problems in literature, as well as possible pitfalls when using available statistical programs that are in itself correct are pointed out. These problems mainly involve (knowledge of) the error structure, as the error structure determines the weighting scheme of the data points in fitting procedures. A simple, robust, statistically correct non\u2010linear least squares (NLLS) method is reintroduced which is based on the visualization of the sum of squares of residuals in the so\u2010called sum of squares space (SSS). The advantages of this method include the fact that the method is easy to understand and can be implemented in simple computer programs, as well as the fact that the method allows important aspects of the error structure to be incorporated. Furthermore, in the SSS the joint confidence interval (JCI) with exact shape can be constructed. The exact shape of the JCI is not always ellipsoidal and following a normal distribution, depending on the linearity of the fitted equations. This can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions.</jats:p>",

The subsequent study on AIBN\u2010initiated systems indicated that MPEGMA caused an increase\u2010then\u2010decrease profile of the MAA conversion with a plateau around an ethylene glycol/MAA ratio of 1\u20132.

Methacrylonitrile (MAN) and acrylonitrile (AN) were chosen as the cyano monomers. The homopolymer of CVA was also prepared and the corresponding yield was close to 60%. All these polymers were characterized by <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR, IR, DSC, and TGA. The percentages of incorporation of AN and MAN in the copolymers were 36 and 56%, respectively. These products showed high glass transition temperatures, <jats:italic>T<jats:sub>g</jats:sub></jats:italic>, ranging between 124 and 142\u00b0C. The thermogravimetry analyses showed that these copolymers are stable up to 200\u00b0C. Dielectric spectroscopy analysis revealed a weak relaxation \u03b2 process below <jats:italic>T<jats:sub>g</jats:sub></jats:italic>. The \u03b1 relaxation phenomena have also been characterized around the <jats:italic>T<jats:sub>g</jats:sub></jats:italic> and associated to the cooperative movements of the polar groups (CN). The values of dielectric relaxation increment were calculated at 150\u00b0C using the Havriliak\u2013Negami equation and indicated that these polymers exhibit interesting dielectric properties comparatively to similar cyano materials. The \u03b1\u2010activation energies were also calculated. New statistic copolymers based on CVA were characterized. The values of the intensity of \u03b1 relaxation show the potential application of such materials in the domain of electronics. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2009</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cationic copolymerizations of tricyclodecane vinyl ether (8\u2010vinyloxytricyclo[5.2.1.0<jats:sup>2,6</jats:sup>]decane, TCDVE, with vinyl ethers containing a functional group such as urethane linkage, acrylate group, and methacrylate group, as a comonomer were carried out to obtain poly(vinyl ether) plastics for optical use. With the hydrogen chloride/zinc chloride initiating system, the homopolymerization rates of these monomers were markedly different from each other, but the reaction rates of each monomer in the copolymerizations were almost identical. All the obtained copolymers displayed unimodal and narrow molecular weights distributions (MWDs). These facts show that the copolymers are most likely to have randomness with respect to monomer sequences. The copolymers obtained with BF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>OEt<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as an initiator, in contrast, had relatively high molecular weights (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 21,900 \u2212 37,200) and broad MWDs (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub>/<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 4.10 \u2212 6.31), which are rather suitable for molding of plastic materials. For the copolymer with the pendant urethane linkages, the existence of hydrogen bonding via urethane linkages among the polymer chains was detected. For the copolymers with the pendant acrylate or methacrylate group, exothermic peaks due to cross\u2010linking reaction were observed at around 150\u00b0C on the heating scan during the DSC measurement and therefore, they formed cross\u2010linked polymers during the molding process above this temperature. Both the hydrogen bonds and the cross\u2010linkages provide the copolymers with good processability and hardness. The optical properties of these copolymers were excellent and similar to those of poly(TCDVE). The transparency (86\u201391%) and refractive index (1.53\u20131.54) of these molded samples were similar to those of conventional optical plastics such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC), whereas their specific gravity (1.08\u20131.12) and water absorption (0.08\u20130.16%) were significantly lower than those of PMMA and PC. The thermal decomposition temperatures of all the copolymers were 298\u2013369\u00b0C, indicating their good thermal stability. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2012</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The monomer reactivity in the complexed copolymerization of vinyl compounds with alkylaluminum halides has been extensively surveyed. Equimolar copolymers were obtained in various combinations of monomers which are classified into two monomer groups, A and B. The group B monomers are conjugated vinyl compounds having nitrile or carbonyl groups in the conjugated position and form complexes with alkylaluminum halides. The group A monomers are donor monomers having low values, such as olefins, haloolefins, dienes, and unsaturated esters. These A monomers belong to the same group of monomers which give alternating copolymers in conventional radical copolymerization with maleic anhydride, SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and so on. In addition the complexed copolymerization has the same specific characteristics as the conventional alternating copolymerization, i.e., high reactivities of allyl\u2010resonance monomers and inner olefins and no transfer of halogen atom to the copolymers in CCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>. These features suggest little or no participation of the A monomer radical. The <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>\u2010<jats:italic>e</jats:italic> scheme is also discussed in terms of the monomer reactivity. More than two monomers selected from groups A and B give multicomponent copolymers in which alternating sequential structures hold with respect to A and B. Anomalous mutual reactivities between two B monomers in the terpolymerization were observed and indicate that the nature of radical in the complexed copolymerization may be different from that expected by the Lewis\u2010Mayo equation. The complexed radical mechanism previously proposed is discussed in connection with the specific behavior mentioned above.</jats:p>",

Even at propylene concentrations as low as 10% the rate of polymerization is proportional to the initiation rate, indicating kinetic control by the propylene.

Two monomers (DTEM and EMA) showed almost equal reactivity toward both propagating species, and the copolymer composition was the same as the comonomer feed. This result means that both the branching and chain length of the hyperbranched molecules can be controlled statistically by the feed monomer ratios.

The copolymerization reactivity ratios deterined according to the Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u0151 method were: r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 1.35, r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.22 for the MA\u2010AAm pair, and r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 1.75, r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.10 for the AA\u2010AAm pair. It has been established that the polymerization rate depends both on the composition of the starting reaction mixture and on the reaction temperature. The differential kinetic curves obtained are unimodal ones, suggesting the occurrence of only one process, i.e. copolymerization. A second maximum in these curves, appearing at elevated temperature, is explained by crosslinking and formation of a water\u2010insoluble fraction. The copolymers obtained are white powders; in contrast to their water\u2010insoluble fractions, the water\u2010soluble ones are not toxic but they are less active as immunomodulators.</jats:p>",

It was found that the activity enhances sharply as Ti content decreases from 0.6 to 0.07 wt %, and shows no significant changes in the Ti content range of 0.6\u20135.0 wt %. The maximum activity (36 kg PE/mmol Ti \u00d7 h \u00d7 bar C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) was observed for TMC with the lowest Ti content.

New data on the effect of hydrogen on MWD of PE have been found. Increasing hydrogen concentration results in broadening the MWD of PE, especially in the case of TMC with high titanium content. The data presented indicate the heterogeneity of active centers of TMC in the reaction of chain transfer with hydrogen. The data on the ethylene\u2013hexene\u20101 copolymerization over TMC with different titanium content are presented. Comonomer reactivity ratios were shown to be independent of the Ti content in TMC. Presumably the difference in activity of these catalysts is mainly caused by the difference in the number of active centers. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We have studied the copolymerization of methacrylate esters, especially methyl methacrylate, with sodium, methacrylate, the former being maintained in a fine particle size with the aid of a water\u2010soluble colloid and rapid stirring. Results have been reproducible. Analytical methods have been worked out for each monomer in the presence of the other, in order to follow the course of the reaction. Several ratios of methyl methacrylate and sodium methacrylate have been investigated under semi\u2010adiabatic conditions, using a persulfate as polymerization initiator. When the two monomers are polymerized together equimolecular ratios, there is a period of inhibition or retardation only in respect of the sodium methacrylate, but this can be avoided by adding methyl methacrylate to sodium methacrylate at incipient polymerization of the latter. It has been possible to deduce a general picture of polymerization, which is as follow: The polymerization of methyl methacrylate follows zero\u2010order kinetics for a large part of the reaction, while that of sodium methacrylate follows first\u2010order kinetics. On increased dilution of the system, the rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate is increased. On the one hand, increase of methyl methacrylate keeping water and sodium methacrylate constant results in little difference in the rate of polymerization of sodium methacrylate or on the proportional rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate. On the other hand, the actual rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate is doubled. \u03b2\u2010Ethoxy ethyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate copolymerize to a lesser extent with sodium methacrylate in the examined ratios. In these cases a larger proportion of the sodium methacrylate remains unpolymerized when polymerized of the ester is virtually complete. Copolymerization is virtually nil between butyl and sodium methacrylates. The possible mechanism of the copolymerization is discussed.</jats:p>",

To develop a new graft polymerization method, the radical polymerization kinetics of APMPA and graft polymerization with the produced macromolecular azo initiator were studied. Because the azo group of APMPA was stable below 80\u00b0C, the vinyl group of APMPA could be polymerized with 2,2\u2032\u2010azobis(2,4\u2010dimethylvaleronitrile) as an initiator at 60 and 70\u00b0C. However, the homopolymerization of APMPA could not proceed because of APMPA self\u2010circulation reactions. Using comonomers such as styrene (ST), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and vinyl acetate, we synthesized copolymers of APMPA. The <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectra of the resulting copolymers showed the incorporation of APMPA. With the copolymer composed of ST and APMPA used as an initiator, the gel permeation chromatogram showed that the high\u2010molecular\u2010mass fraction of the grafted polymer increased with time. By this method, grafted copolymers having branched chains composed of ST, MMA, or an amphiphilic macromonomer were obtained. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010</jats:p>",

Carbon monoxide copolymerized with difficulty with ethylenimine with \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile as radical initiator. In the presence of a small amount of ethylene, however, a remarkable amount of crystalline powdery poly\u2010\u03b2\u2010alanine (nylon 3) was obtained. The crystalline copolymer, which mainly consists of nylon 3 and contains a small amount of nylon 5 and other substances of higher homologous nylon structure, was obtained in the presence of a large amount of ethylene. This copolymer scarcely contained any ketone structure. Increasing the total feed of the equimolar mixture of the monomers increased the conversion of total monomer and nylon 3 content in the copolymer formed. The effect of increasing carbon monoxide content in this system was to increase both the conversion and the nylon 3 content in the copolymer. In both cases the copolymers were almost identical with nylon 3. Increased ethylene content in the monomer feed, however, increased the conversion and the content of higher homologous nylon structures, such as nylon 5 and 7. From the results it was concluded that ethylene was involved not only in the propagation reaction but also particularly in the initiation reaction.</jats:p>",

Kinetics of suspension emulsion copolymerization of AN with IA were studied. Effects of various mass ratios of water/monomer, initiator concentrations, emulsifier concentrations and dispersant concentrations on AN/IA copolymerization rate and changes of particle size and size distribution with the extension of polymerization time were investigated. It was found that the copolymerization rate increased with water/monomer mass ratio and KPS concentration. Span60 concentration and PVA concentration had no obvious effect on the polymerization rate. Finally, a suspension emulsion polymerization mechanism for AN and IA was proposed.</jats:p>",

The structure of the monomers was varied in terms of the zwitterion intercharge spacing and the bulkiness of the alkyl substituents at the quaternary ammonium unit. Four of the five zwitterionic sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBM) monomers used in the study were synthesized. An evaluation of the reactivity ratios for the copolymer systems was performed with programs based on statistically sound techniques such as the error\u2010in\u2010variables model and the nonlinear\u2010least\u2010squares method. Reactivity ratio estimates for all 10 comonomer pairs were obtained, and they showed clear variations in reactivity with the structure of the SBM.

The temperature was varied from \u221230 to \u221294\u00b0C., and the monomer/solvent ratio, the ratio of monomers, and the catalyst concentration were varied over a considerable range. The copolymerization equation was found to be applicable to the data, and the reactivity ratios were determined for various experimental conditions. For an \u201copen\u201d system in which the volume steadily increases during the course of polymerization, it is shown that the copolymerization equation is formally identical to that of Mayo and Lewis, except that concentrations are replaced by amounts of the reacting species. The temperature coefficients of the reactivity ratios in the present system are compared with those for free\u2010radical systems; some important differences are noted. The reactivity ratios of isobutylene and styrene in the present system are greatly increased under conditions of turbulent agitation. A procedure for the compositional fractionation of the copolymers is described. The results are interpreted in terms of the copolymer chain structure; they appear to admit the postulate that the reactivity ratios and corresponding propagation rate constants are functions of chain length.</jats:p>",

The character of the radical was tested further in a study of the ESR spectrum. The variation in grafting rates and energies of activation required for graft copolyermization at various mole ratios of the monomers was observed.

The purpose of the present work was to examine the homopolymerization and copolymerization of <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010allyl, <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010undecenyl and <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010vinylbenzyl polystyrene (PS) macromonomers, in the presence of early or late transition metal catalysts. The influence of several parameters (type of catalytic system, nature of polymerizable end\u2010group and molar mass of the macromonomer) on the homopolymerization was first investigated. Whereas <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010allyl or <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010undecenyl PS macromonomers were not very reactive in homopolymerization whatever the catalyst, <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010vinylbenzyl PS macromonomers gave interesting results with CpTiCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/MAO and Cp*TiCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/MAO.

On the contrary, the incorporation of <jats:italic>\u03c9</jats:italic>\u2010allyl PS macromonomers was achieved. Moreover, for macromonomers containing an alkyl spacer between the allylic unit and the PS chain, the incorporation rate, the copolymerization yield and the molar masses of the copolymers were increased, giving access to a new type of graft copolymer structure.</jats:p><jats:p>\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Synthesis of polystyrene macromonomers.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>Synthesis of polystyrene macromonomers.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

The SPAEK membranes did not exhibit excessive swelling in hot water and at the same time show the proton conductivities in the range of 0.030 S/cm to 0.099 S/cm at 80\u00b0C. The methanol diffusion coefficients of the SPAEK membranes were in the range of 4.7 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22127</jats:sup> to 8.1 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22127</jats:sup>cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/s measured at 25\u00b0C. The transport properties of this series of SPAEK copolymers were compared to poly(aryl ether ether ketone)s (SPEEK), poly(aryl ether ether ketone ketone)s (SPEEKK), and Nafion\u00ae membranes. It was found that the transport properties (including proton conductivity and methanol permeability) follows the trend of SPEEKK\u201060 &lt; SPAEK\u201060 &lt; SPEEK\u201060 &lt; Nafion\u00ae 117, the order of which is also attributed to the differences in the chemical structure of the polymers and the membrane morphology. In general, this novel series of SPAEK membranes possess various advantages, such as low cost of the initial monomers, high thermal and mechanical stability, and low methanol permeability while simultaneously possessing sufficient proton conductivity, which makes them notably promising as proton exchange membrane (PEM) materials in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For the purpose of synthesizing raw materials for preparation of modified polyvinyl alcohol with enhanced performance characteristics, the copolymerization of vinyl acetate with itaconic acid and diethyl itaconate at concentrations up to 9 mol % in methanol solution using azo\u2010bis\u2010isobutyronitrile and <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butylcyclohexylperoxydicarbonate as initiators has been studied. The experiments were performed using two different methods of addition of the itaconic monomer\u2014single, at the beginning of the process, and continuous. It was established that the process rate decreases as the quantity of the second comonomer increases. The reaction order in terms of itaconic acid ( \u22122, 95) and reactivity ratios for both pairs vinyl acetate and itacinic acid (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.053 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 31) and vinyl acetate and diethyl itaconate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.125 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 18) were determined.

The reactivity ratios calculated from the composition data indicate that the propagation rate constants favor addition of trifluoropropylene by a factor of 3\u20137; individual values depended little on the polymerization pressure and temperature. Polymerization rates changed little with monomer composition between 0 and 75% tetrafluoroethylene; between 75 and 95% tetrafluoroethylene they increased by a factor of 10. As many as 850,000 molecules were polymerized per 100 e.v. absorbed. The copolymers are soluble in hexafluorobenzene at 29.6\u00b0C. if they contain less than 70% tetrafluoroethylene. Intrinsic viscosities range from 0.1 to about 10 dl./g. From various considerations it appears likely that the degree of polymerization is about equal to the kinetic chain length in high\u2010pressure polymerizations at 21\u00b0C.; at autogenous pressure or at 5000 atm and 100\u00b0C., monomer transfer reduces the value considerably.</jats:p>",

We use atomic force microscopy for the dry-state characterization of the microgel particles and photon correlation spectroscopy to investigate the swelling behavior at neutral (pH 7) and acidic (pH 4) conditions. A transition between an interpenetrating network structure for microgels with a pure poly-N,-n-propylacrylamide (PNNPAM) shell and a distinct core-shell morphology for microgels with a pure poly-N-isopropylmethacrylamide (PNIPMAM) shell is observable. The PNIPMAM molfraction of the shell also has an important influence on the particle rigidity because of the decreasing degree of interpenetration. Furthermore, the swelling behavior of the microgels is tunable by adjustment of the pH-value between a single-step volume phase transition and a linear swelling region at temperatures corresponding to the copolymer ratios of the shell. This flexibility makes the multiresponsive copolymer microgels interesting candidates for many applications, e.g., as membrane material with tunable permeability.</jats:p>",

In this work, a polyethylene hollow\u2010fiber membrane was modified by this technique. The monomers glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and <jats:italic>N,N\u2010</jats:italic>dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) were cografted onto macroporous polyethylene hollow fiber with a grafting degree in the order of 200%. DMAA/GMA cografted membranes were compared to GMA grafted ones for the introduction of an amino acid as a specific ligand. Grafted membranes with a copolymer composition between 0 and 2 DMAA/GMA were prepared by soaking them in solutions of different mixtures of monomers. Copolymers were characterized by FTIR and their composition was estimated by the analysis of the ratio of carbonyl signals. Copolymers with a higher proportion of DMAA showed improved hydrophilic properties and higher conversion rates of epoxy groups on phenyalanine ligands than those of the GMA grafted ones. However, copolymers with a DMAA/GMA ratio higher than 1 showed a detrimental effect on the pure water flux. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 87: 1646\u20131653, 2003</jats:p>",

The kinetics of catalytic copolymerization had not been studied until the present. There has been only a little work published in connection with determining the composition of copolymers and calculating the copolymerization constants for the systems in question. We initiated some research into the dependence of the speed of catalytic copolymerization on the composition of the original mixture, in conjunction with a determination of the speeds of separate polymerization of the monomers involved, since a comparison of data on the kinetics of copolymerization with that of separate polymerization gives a more complete representation of the mechanism of the process. A study was made of the speed of copolymerization of the systems : isoprene-butadiene and styrene-butadiene, and also of the kinetics of separate polymerization of these monomers. Polymerization was carried out in ethyl chloride with stannic chloride as the catalyst, at 0\u00b0 C, by the dilatometric method.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this article, we offer clear evidence for the radical copolymerizability of porphyrin rings in 2,2,6,6\u2010tetramethyl\u20101\u2010piperidinyloxy (TEMPO)\u2010mediated radical copolymerizations with styrene. The radical copolymerizations of styrene with 5,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP) was conducted using 1\u2010phenyl\u20101\u2010(2,2,6,6\u2010tetramethyl\u20101\u2010piperidinyloxy)ethane as an initiator. The refractive index (RI) traces for the size\u2010exclusion chromatography of the resulting copolymers were unimodal with narrow molecular weight distributions. The RI traces shifted toward higher molecular weight regions as the polymerization progressed, and the number\u2010average molecular weights were close to those calculated on the basis of the feed compositions and monomer conversions. These features were in good agreement with a TEMPO\u2010mediated mechanism. The traces recorded by the ultraviolet\u2010visible (UV\u2010vis) detector (430 nm) were identical to those obtained by the RI detector, indicating a statistical copolymerization of styrene with H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP. This also indicated that H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP acted as a monomer and not as a terminator or a chain\u2010transfer agent under the conditions used. A benzyl radical addition to H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP was conducted as a model reaction for the copolymerization using tributyltin hydride as a chain\u2010transfer agent, affording a reduced porphyrin, 2\u2010benzyl\u20105,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)chlorin <jats:bold>1</jats:bold>, via radical addition to the \u03b2\u2010pyrrole position.

The monomer reactivity ratios of BHFIPF (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and styrene (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) were calculated as <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.00 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.02. BHFIPF also copolymerized with vinyl pentafluorobenzoate (VPFB) in bulk and in pentafluoroisopropanol solution to produce an alternating copolymer.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the previous papers it had been shown that the polyether\u2010polyacetal interaction leads in the presence of BF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> to the formation of block copolymers. In the present paper the influence of different polyethers on the copolymerization of trioxane with dioxolane was studied. Several observations suggest the formation of block copolymer, mainly on the surface of particles of the precipitated copolymer. Particles are much smaller (diameters 8\u201312\u03bc) than those of copolymers prepared in the absence of polyethers (25\u2013100 \u03bc). The overall reactivities of comonomers are also changed; the relative reactivity of trioxane \u2013 which is less basic and less reactive in copolymerization \u2013 increases almost twice. As a tentative explanation the participation of the basic polyether in the solvation shell of the ion pair is proposed. Due to the increase in reactivity of trioxane the composition of copolymer prepared in the presence of polyether is more uniform, and the content of the unstable fraction is lower.</jats:p><jats:p>These two primary effects are responsible for several consequences: Since the smaller particles have the same specific surface (ca. 25 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g), the surface of these particles is smoother. The reaction mixture, containing as much as 60 wt.\u2010% of solid copolymer, is fluid. A monomolecular layer of polyether (partially in the form of blocks, partially adsorbed) on the polyacetal particle surface seems to be sufficient to cause the observed phenomena. This outer polyether skin prevents the agglomeration of polyacetal particles.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Confidence contours in parameter space are a helpful tool to compare and classify determined estimators. For more intricate parameter estimations of non-linear nature or complex error structures, the procedure of determining confidence contours is a statistically complex task. For polymer chemists, such particular cases are encountered in determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization. Hereby, determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization requires non-linear parameter estimation. Additionally, data may possess (possibly correlated) errors in both dependent and independent variables. A common approach for such non-linear estimations is the error-in-variables model yielding statistically unbiased estimators. Regarding reactivity ratios, to date published procedures neglect the non-Gaussian structure of the error estimates which is a consequence of the non-linearity of the model. In this publication, this issue is addressed by employing a Bayesian hierarchical model, which correctly propagates the errors of all variables. We detail the statistical procedure in chemist friendly language to encourage confident usage of our tool. Our approach is based on a \\texttt{Python} program requiring minimal installation effort. A detailed manual of the code is included in the appendix of this work, in an effort to make this procedure available to all interested polymer chemists.</jats:p>",

The effect of the grinding of quartz on the copolymerization was investigated by characterizing both the polymer formed and the ground quartz. The copolymerization proceeds apparently from the quartz grindings and was closely related to the total surface area of the ground quartz. The molecular weight distributions of the copolymers formed were unimodal as found in a homopolymer of only methyl methacrylate. It was clear from the composition analysis of the copolymer that the mechanochemical copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene proceeded with a radical polymerization mechanism because of radicals on the quartz surface produced by the grinding. The monomer reactivity ratios obtained by the Fineman\u2010Ross method suggested that the copolymers formed were alternating copolymers. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The coatings are relatively uniform and their properties, especially their modulus, can be systematically varied by controlling the monomer ratio in the eletrolyte solution. This technique is being used to introduce a ductile interlayer of contrlled composition and thickness between the composite fibers and matrix.

These copolymers have fairly high molecular weight, in the range of 100,000 g/mol. Monomer reactivity ratios were determined, based upon free radical polymerization kinetics, from cyclic voltammetry. An indirect initiation mechanism is suggested. Bonding between interlayer and matrix can be improved by introducing vinyl monomers with proper functional groups, capable of reacting with the epoxy resin, at the last stage of the electropolymerization process.</jats:p>",

It was found that, when hydroperoxides were used as cocatalysts, triethylboron and tri-rc-butylboron were active as catalysts, while triphenylboron was inactive. As cocatalysts,, hydroperoxides were more active than disubstituted peroxides. The highest catalytic activity was observed when the cocatalyst/catalyst molar ratio was 0.4. The initiating radical has been suggested to be the hydroxy radical, and the initiating mechanism has been discussed briefly. The yield and the reduced specific viscosity of the copolymer decrease rapidly with an increase in the ethylene content of the monomer mixture. The monomer reactivity ratios were: r1(vinyl chloride) = 4.16 and r2(ethylene) = 0.05. This indicates that the copolymerization reaction proceeds via a normal radical mechanism. The resulting copolymer shows characteristic absorption peaks at 750 cm\u22121 in the infrared spectrum and at 8.37 \u03c4 in the NMR spectrum.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Up to now catalytic copolymerization with alkali catalysts has hardly been studied. Only a few papers have been published which give quantitative data. Judging by the values of the copolymerization constants, monomers differ very considerably in their reactivities. Monomers in which the double bond of the vinyl group is conjugated with the multiple bond of a nitrile or a carboxyl group have the greatest activity. The copolymerization of diene hydrocarbons under the action of basic catalysts has not been investigated as yet. It is known that in free radical (emulsion) polymerization these hydrocarbons have relatively similar activities. It seemed interesting to establish the relative reactivity of the diene hydrocarbons, isoprene and 1,3-butadiene, which differ by only a methyl group, in alkali-catalyzed copolymerization. Labeled atoms were used for determining the composition of the copolymers. For this we synthesized isoprene containing radioactive carbon, C14 (from acetylene-C14, prepared from BaC14O3) by a modification of Favorskii\u02d8's method. Copolymerization and separate polymerizations of isoprene and 1,3-butadiene were carried out in hexane solution with butyllithium at 50\u00b0, with a total monomer concentration of 2 moles/liter and a catalyst concentration of 0.0025 mole/liter. Butyllithium was synthesized by the known method. The butyllithium solution was analyzed by the usual method with a double titration. Thoroughly purified and dried monomers and solvent were used for the polymerization. All operations of measuring out the products into the reaction ampules were carried out in a current of dry nitrogen and in a vacuum apparatus having a distributing comb (manifold). The reaction ampules consisted of two sections, separated by a wall and connected with a graduate tube. The solvent and monomers were placed in one section and the catalyst, a solution of butyllithium in hexane, in the other.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios based on one copolymerization model can be derived from the reactivity ratios of the other model. Predicted copolymer composition, based on both models, will agree with the observed experimental data within the precision of the usual methods used for copolymer analysis. Hypothetical cases and examples from the literature all show this behavior. The literature comonomer systems were \u03b1\u2010methylstyrene\u2013acrylonitrile, and styrene with maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, and acrylonitrile. Polymer structure, however, predicted by the two mechanisms do differ appreciably in detail. In particular, predictions of the sequential arrangements of the monomers in the copolymers produced are different for the terminal and penultimate mechanisms. It would seem that the development of experimental procedures for determining the sequential arrangement of the comonomers will be necessary before one can easily and definitely distinguish between terminal and penultimate copolymerization models for a particular system.</jats:p>",

Pyridine was found to inhibit the grafting totally. The properties of the grafted fibers such as density, diameter, dyeability, and moisture regain were also investigated. It was concluded due to the observations made in these properties that the grafting took place mainly in the subsurface regions of the fibers and there occurred a diffusion barrier after the grafting value of 8\u20139%.

The copolymerization in SSS monomer feed of 0.2\u20135 mole\u2010% occurs in the transition phase from homogeneous to heterogeneous, and the system is very viscous and slightly cloudy.

High\u2010molecular\u2010weight polyacrylonitrile (PAN) copolymers were acquired by adjustment of technical polymerization parameters. When the amount of IA in the feed reached 2 wt %, the conversion of the polymerization reaction, intrinsic viscosity, and viscosity\u2010average molecular weight all achieved their maximum values, whereas the molecular weight distribution achieved its minimum value. The AN/IA reactivity ratios, calculated with <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>\u2013<jats:italic>e</jats:italic> schemes (where <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> are measures of the reactivity and polarity, respectively), agreed well with those determined with the Fineman\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f5s methods. The thermal properties and structural characteristics of the PAN polymers were measured with differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The introduction of IA into the polymerization system was found to be propitious for the preoxidation of the PAN polymers, and the characteristic absorption bands of C\uf8fdN, C\uf8feO, or O\uf8ffH existed in the polymer main chains. With an increase in the required amount of IA in the polymerization system, the exothermic figure of the exotherms became broader, and the intensity of the C\uf8feO and O\uf8ffH absorption bands became stronger. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The activity of the supported catalyst was only one\u2010half to one\u2010eighth of that of the homogeneous catalyst, depending on the comonomer type. The supported catalyst copolymerized more comonomer into the polymer chain than the homogeneous catalyst at the same monomer feed ratio. Data of reactivity ratios showed that the depression in the activity of propylene instead of an enhancement in the activity of olefinic comonomer was responsible for this phenomenon. We also found that copolymerization with \u03b1\u2010olefins and supporting the metallocene on a carrier improved the stereoregularity and regioregularity of the copolymers. The melting temperature of all the copolymers decreased linearly with growing comonomer content, regardless of the comonomer type and catalyst system.

Vacuum\u2010dried residual copolymer products (RCP) were analyzed by gel\u2010permeation chromatography (GPC), vapor\u2010pressure osmometry (VPO) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR). Attempts to homopolymerize THF in equimolar mixtures of DCE and THF at THF/TPMHFP ratios of 1:1 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> proved futile, while the homopolymerization of PO under identical operating conditions took place quite readily. Copolymerizations of PO\u2013THF mixtures were easily carried out with high and often complete consumption of both monomers though, more often than not, THF was the principal residual monomer at the end of the 24 hr reaction period since, under no circumstances could additional THF be polymerized when the PO charged was completely consumed. Linearity of plots of \u2212ln (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>) versus time showed the reactions to be first order with respect to both PO and THF concentrations. Influence of temperature reveals, via Arrhenius plots and overall activation energies (16.0 kcal/mole for PO and 13.0 kcal/mole for THF), that the initiator system functions similarly to other reported systems. Reactivity ratios (0.26 for PO and 0.80 for THF) indicate that monomer units tend to alternate along the chains rather than form extended segments of a given kind. This is supported by NMR analyses of RCP samples. Bimodal GPC distributions observed in the present study suggest that the copolymerization reaction may be proceeding by either a dual mechanism or a two\u2010step process.</jats:p>",

The kinetically determined microstructure (gradient, alternate, etc.) observed in the first stage of copolymerization is related to reactivity ratios. It evolves into the equilibrium microstructure, determined exclusively by the equilibrium constants and initial conditions.

In the copolymerizations, DBF indicated much higher reactivity than the comonomers, and the products comprised mainly of DBF units. NMR, UV, and fluorescence spectra, as well as electrochemical features indicated that the copolymers possess both isolated and rather short, sequential (meth)acrylate units, as well as \u03c0-stacked and unstacked DBF sequences. Isolated (meth)acrylate units are proposed to be sandwiched between DBF units. The ratios of \u03c0-stacked and unstacked side-chain fluorene groups of DBF units in excited states were accurately determined on the basis of fluorescent emission spectra; DBF units are mostly \u03c0-stacked in excited states as disclosed by fluorescence spectra. Two types of \u03c0-stacked sequences were suggested to be present in the ground state by electrochemical analysis. The copolymers exhibited higher solubility than pure poly(DBF).</jats:p>",

The approach used was to measure the rate of formation of disappearance of the styryl anion spectrophotometrically, using the absorption peak at 436 m\u03bc. The solutions of butadienyl and styryl anions (in benzene) were prepared by reacting butyllithium with small amounts of butadiene or styrene, in a preliminary step, until the initiation reaction was complete. Subsequently, each of the anionic solutions was mixed with the opposite monomer, and the cross\u2010propagation reaction measured spectrophotometrically. It was found that the rate of the reaction of the styryl anion with butadiene was <jats:italic>extremely rapid</jats:italic>, being virtually completed in less than one minute at room temperature. On the other hand, the rate of reaction of the butadienyl anions with styrene was easily measurable at room temperature, being of the same order as the previously measured homopolymerization rates for butadiene. These measurements enabled a calculation of the following reactivity ratios: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub> = 3, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>S</jats:sub> = .06. This very large difference in cross\u2010propagation rates can easily account for the \u201canomalour\u201d behavior previously found by several investigators, wherein butadiene polymerized preferentially in a mixture with styrene, and which had been attributed to special \u201csolvation\u201d effects by the butadiene.</jats:p>",

The polyurethane dispersions were synthesized with isophorone diisocyanate, 1000 and 2000 molecular weight polyester polyols, 1000 molecular weight polyether polyol, butanediol, and dimethylol propionic acid. Acrylic monomers were added in the monomer emulsion feed. We studied the effect of the use of different polyurethane seed particles and the effect of different weight ratios of methyl methacrylate to butyl acrylate on the emulsion properties, microphase structure, and mechanical properties of hybrid films. The average particle size and distribution were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. The rheological properties of polyurethane dispersions and hybrid emulsions were tested under destructive conditions by an examination of flow curves and under nondestructive conditions of oscillatory shear in a range of linear viscoelastic responses. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed to characterize the thermal\u2010response properties of polymeric films. The relative average molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography. The interactions between the acrylic and polyurethane components in hybrid particles and particle structure were studied with infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mechanical properties such as the Koenig hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young's modulus were measured. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Percentage of grafting and percent efficiency have been determined as functions of concentration of monomers, molar ratios of [TBHP]/[FAS], time and temperture. Molar ratios of [TBHP]/[FAS] were found to influence grafting of different monomers studied. Chemical evidence indicates that a covalent bond formation occurs between grafted polymeric chain and backbone polymer.

This initiator shows a high activity to give high\u2010molar\u2010mass PTMCs with molar\u2010mass distributions ranging from 1.2 to 1.4, and with a regular structure void of ether linkages. The polymers were characterized by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C\u2005NMR spectroscopy, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H COSY, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C HMQC NMR spectroscopy, size\u2010exclusion chromatography (SEC), viscosimetry, and MALDI\u2010TOF MS analyses.

The experimentally observed DS values were close to the expected values derived from the starting material ratios. The thermal stabilities of the SPAEKs were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, which showed that in acid and sodium salt forms they were thermally stable in air up to about 240 and 380 \u00b0C, respectively. Transparent membranes cast from the directly polymerized SPAEKs exhibited good mechanical properties in both dry and hydrated states. The dependence of water uptake and of membrane swelling on the DS at different temperatures was studied. SPAEK membranes with a DS from 0.72 to 1.60 maintained adequate mechanical properties after immersion in water at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h.

The kinetic models concerning the participation of charge\u2010transfer complexed (CTC) monomer and homopolymerization or otherwise, and kinetic\u2010 or diffusion\u2010controlled termination are generalized into one equation. The quantitative treatment method proposed can give monomer reactivity ratios without concerning the specific kinetic model.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of crosslink density, type and concentration of initiator, the use of a complex initiator system, porogen, and diluent on the most relevant parameters of FP, such as sustainability of the front, temperature profile, front velocity, and yield. The products were also characterized for intruded pore volume, pore\u2010size distribution, epoxy\u2010functionality number, and surface morphology. Higher crosslink densities (CLDs) and initiator concentration produced higher front velocities, whereas no trend in front temperature was noted. A complex initiation system was effective in stabilizing and increasing the polymerization yield. Relative to suspension polymerization (SP), FP products synthesized without a solvent were microporous, whereas micro\u2010to\u2010macroporous products were obtained in the presence of a solvent (for HEMA\u2013EGDM polymers). We also present, explain, and discuss the exotic patterns observed under a microscope. We observed two basic types of spatial patterns, namely, planar and nonplanar patterns. The type of planar pattern observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has a spatial impulse that appears as a loop followed by regular periodic motion in the radial and axial directions. This behavior gives rise to a repeating pattern that is a few microns thick. Also, nonplanar patterns, namely, layered concentric rings and winding staircase patterns, were observed under SEM.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Bifunctional comonomer 2-methylenesuccinamic acid (MLA) was designed and synthesized to prepare acrylonitrile copolymer P (AN-co-MLA) using mixed solvent polymerization as a carbon fiber precursor. The effect of monomer feed ratios on the structure and stabilization were characterized by elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), proton nuclear magnetic (1H NMR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the P (AN-co-MLA) copolymers. The results indicated that both the conversion and molecular weight of polymerization reduce gradually when the MLA content is increased in the feed and that bifunctional comonomer MLA possesses a larger reactivity ratio than acrylonitrile (AN). P (AN-co-MLA) shows improved stabilization compared to the PAN homopolymer and poly (acrylonitrile-acrylic acid-methacrylic acid) [P (AN-AA-MA)], showing features such as lower initiation temperature, smaller cyclic activation energy, wider exothermic peak, and a larger stabilization degree, which are due to the ionic cyclization reaction initiated by MLA, confirming that the as-prepared P (AN-co-MLA) is the potential precursor for high-performance carbon fiber.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>After a brief review of the characteristics of the copolymerization of donor and acceptor monomers in the presence of metal halides, a mechanism is proposed for the formation of alternating copolymers. The charge\u2010transfer donor\u2010acceptor complex resulting from the interaction of a strong electron\u2010acceptor monomer and a strong electron\u2010donor monomer undergoes spontaneous or radical initiated homopolymerization to yield an equimolar alternating copolymer, irrespective of the initial monomer ratio. The formation of the [D<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-1.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:04492994:media:POLC5070310122:tex2gif-stack-1\" />A] complex is enhanced by complexation of the acceptor monomer with a metal halide or organometal halide. The homopolymerization of the (D<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-2.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:04492994:media:POLC5070310122:tex2gif-stack-2\" />A\u2026 [MX] occurs at a faster rate than conventional radical copolymerization. The spontaneous polymerization occurs when the equilibrium concentration of the complex is sufficiently high. The latter depends upon the electron\u2010donating strength of the donor monomer and the electron\u2010accepting strength of the acceptor monomer and the activator. Complex formation is favored at lower temperatures while polymerization may require thermal or catalytic activation. The complexes may be aligned in an ordered array or matrix, and polymerization proceeds through a rapid initial stage in which the molecular weight increases with conversion, followed by a slower stage in which the molecular weight remains constant at the highest level attained in the first stage, indicative of the first\u2010stage polymer acting as a template for the second\u2010stage polymerization. The proposed polymerization mechanism involves initiation by a head\u2010to\u2010head reaction of two complexes during which hydrogen abstraction or transfer occurs through a six\u2010membered cyclic transition state to generate a polymer chain with an attached terminal complex. The propagation reaction is head\u2010to\u2010tail and involves the addition of complexes to the chain end through hydrogen abstraction via a six\u2010membered cyclic transition state to regenerate the complex chain end.</jats:p>",

By proper selection of the catalytic system and the reaction conditions, a variety of copolymers with different compositions, structures, and properties can be obtained. Thus, copolymers containing a very low amount of styrene (or p-methylstyrene) on a substantially polyethylenic backbone are crystalline thermoplastics, which could be used to produce functionalized PEs. Increasing the styrene content leads to a rapid decrease in the crystallinity, affording materials which show good thermoelastomeric properties. Copolymers containing around 20 mol % styrene are effective compatibilizers for polyethylene\u2014polystyrene blends. The molecular structure of these copolymers has been defined being \u201cpseudorandom,\u201d since EEE, EES, ESE, and SES sequences are observed, and no SS sequences are present, thus the styrene content cannot exceed 50 mol %. Very recently, however, a random copolymer containing SS sequences in a stereoregular arrangement has been reported. Also, truly alternating E-S copolymers have been obtained with suitable catalysts. These poly(ethylene-alt-styrenes) can be either atactic (and thus amorphous) or stereoregular, depending on the particular catalyst used. Interestingly, isotactic poly(ethylene-alt-styrene) is a new crystalline material with a melting point of 145 \u00b0C, whose crystal structure has recently been determined. In conclusion, further research on ethylene\u2014styrene copolymerization promises to afford a variety of new interesting materials starting from two widespread, easily available and inexpensive monomers.</jats:p>",

The final product consists of a homopolymer nucleus surrounded by concentric shells of copolymers with different composition; the initial composition is quite rich in the monomer that forms the nucleus while the process ends with an enriched layer of the second homopolymer. Since the middle copolymer layer tends to increase the compatibility among the original homopolyers, we expected to have a set of core\u2010shell products with completely different properties. However, the experimental results showed that this was not the case. The composition effect on the viscoelastic properties shows, on one hand, that an increase in the butyl acrylate content lowers the elastic response of the final product, and on the other hand, that the elasticity increases with copolymer content. As the initiator content in the reaction media increases, the viscosity of the coreshell products decreases because of the existence of a media flooded with free radicals. If the butyl acrylate is first added, a graft polymerization is favored because of the polar nature of this homopolymer and, therefore, the molecular weight level increases.</jats:p>",

In the simplest case of free\u2010radical copolymerization, a mixture of monomers and initiator is placed into a test tube. Reaction is initiated at one end of the tube, and a self\u2010sustained thermal wave, in which chemical conversion occurs, develops and propagates through the tube. We develop a mathematical model of the frontal copolymerization process and analytically determine the structure of the polymerization wave, the propagation velocity, maximum temperature, and degree of conversion of the monomers. Specifically, we examine their dependence on reactivity ratios as well as other kinetic parameters, monomer feed composition, and exothermicity of the reactions. Our analytic results are in good quantitative agreement with both direct numerical simulations of the model and experimental data, which are also presented in the paper.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Dependence of front velocity on monomer feed composition for different heat release parameters.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"urn:x-wiley:10221344:media:MATS200390028:gra001\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>Dependence of front velocity on monomer feed composition for different heat release parameters.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

The batch reactions were performed with [RuCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(PPh<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(amine)] complex types as precatalysts, where amine is perhydroazepine (<jats:bold>1</jats:bold>) or piperidine (<jats:bold>2</jats:bold>), in CHCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (2 mL) in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate (5 \u03bcL) for different intervals of times (5, 30, 60, and 120 min) at 40\u00b0C.

Being swollen, these amorphous chain segments become sufficiently mobile to contribute to the SSP process. The thermal behavior of the resulting copolyesters is comparable with melt copolymerized copolymers, although having a different chemical microstructure. The main reason is a full miscibility in the melt of unmodified PBT chain segments and modified chain segments, which eliminates the advantages of a blocky microstructure for the SSP copolyesters. However, incorporation of 2,2\u2032\u2010biphenyldimethanol (BDM) into PBT resulted in a higher crystallization temperature compared with PBT\u2013Dianol copolymers of equal composition. Preordering of polymer chains in the melt by incorporating rigid, phase separating BDM\u2010moieties, preferably via SSP to obtain a non\u2010random distribution, may be the origin of the enhanced crystallization temperature. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the cesium pivalate-catalyzed self-switchable polymerization of glutaric anhydride (GA), butylene oxide (BO), and LLA using a diol initiator, the ROAC of GA and BO proceeded whereas the ROP of LLA simultaneously proceeded very slowly, resulting in a copolyester consisting of poly(GA-alt-BO) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) segments with tapered regions, that is, PLLA-tapered block-poly(GA-alt-BO)-tapered block-PLLA (PLLA-tb-poly(GA-alt-BO)-tb-PLLA). Additionally, a series of tapered-block or real-block copolyesters consisting of poly(anhydride-alt-epoxide) (A segment) and PLLA (B segment) with AB-, BAB-, (AB)3-, and (AB)4-type architectures of different compositions and molecular weights were synthesized by varying the monomer combinations, alcohol initiators, and initial feed ratios. The lap shear tests of these copolyesters revealed an excellent relationship between the adhesive strength and polymer structural parameters. The (AB)4-type star-block copolyester (poly(GA-alt-BO)-tb-PLLA)4 exhibited the best adhesive strength (6.74 \u00b1 0.64 MPa), comparable to that of commercial products, such as PE-based and poly(vinyl acetate)-based hot-melt adhesives.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Due to their good mechanical properties, high molecular weight polyesters (PEs) are highly desirable for a wide range of applications especially in the packaging industry. However, the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers by energy efficient methods is difficult. In this study, a series of semi\u2010aromatic PEs were synthesized via the alternating ring\u2010opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of phthalic anhydride (PA) and cyclohexene oxide (CHO) using a salen chromium(III) complex as a catalyst and 4\u2010(dimethylamino)pyridine as a cocatalyst. By varying the molar ratios between CHO and PA, PEs of different molecular weights were obtained. Hexamethylene diisocyanate was used as a chain extender that further increased the molecular weights of these PEs. These chain extended aromatic polyesters (PE\u2010Xs) showed significant improvement in the glass transition temperature (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub>) values. Thus, integration of ROCOP with the chain extension method can be used as an effective strategy to prepare high molecular weight PEs with improved thermal stabilities and enhanced mechanical properties. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>In the present study, copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene was conducted with a series of ansa-fluorenylamidodimethyltitanium complexes, including [t-BuNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 (complex 1), [cyclododecylNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 (complex 2) and [t-BuNSiMe2(2,7-t-Bu2Flu)]TiMe2 (complex 3), activated by MMAO. The effect of these catalysts on catalytic behavior, namely activity, molecular weight and monomer reactivity ratios, has been investigated. The results showed that all of them acted by a single site polymerization mechanism and the molecular weight distribution is independent of catalyst structure. Based on the study, it revealed that the introduction of a t-butyl at the 2,7 position on the fluorenyl ligand is able to enhance both catalytic activity and copolymer molecular weight more than introducing a cyclododecyl on the amine, which is probably associated with the electronic effect exerted by the t-butyl substituent. The comonomer incorporation content was controllable over a wide range by adjusting the comonomer feed ratio. Moreover, referring to monomer reactivity ratio exploration, it seems that the substitution on the ansa-fluorenylamidodimethyltitanium complex tends to hinder the insertion of 1-hexene into the polymer chain, leading to the highest 1-hexene content for traditional complex 1.</jats:p>",

The esters without conjugated unsaturation show little tendency to enter a copolymer with styrene, but copolymers containing up to 40% by weight of conjugated linoleate can be obtained. Linoleic, linolenic, and conjugated linoleic esters copolymerize readily with acrylonitrile. Products containing up to 45 mole %, 80 wt %, of the conjugated ester can be made. However, methyl eleostearate, with three conjugated double bonds, inhibits the polymerization of both styrene and acrylonitrile. Quantitative comparisons of the behaviors of the esters are made through the copolymerization equation. The probable performance of these and other vinyl monomers in copolymerization with linseed oil is discussed.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Homogeneity of copolymers is a general problem of catalytic coordination polymerization. In ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters, the rational design of the catalyst is generally applied to solve this problem by the equalization of the reactivities of comonomers\u2014however, it often leads to a reduction of catalytic activity. In the present paper, we studied the catalytic behavior of BnOH-activated complexes (BHT)Mg(THF)2nBu (1), (BHT)2AlMe (2) and [(BHT)ZnEt]2 (3), based on 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT-H) in homo- and copolymerization of L-lactide (lLA) and \u03b5-caprolactone (\u03b5CL). Even at 1:5 lLA/\u03b5CL ratio Mg complex 1 catalyzed homopolymerization of lLA without involving \u03b5CL to the formation of the polymer backbone. On the contrary, Zn complex 3 efficiently catalyzed random lLA/\u03b5CL copolymerization; the presence of mono-lactate subunits in the copolymer chain clearly pointed to the transesterification mechanism of copolymer formation. Both epimerization and transesterification side processes were analyzed using the density functional theory (DFT) modeling that confirmed the qualitative difference in catalytic behavior of 1 and 3: Mg and Zn complexes demonstrated different types of preferable coordination on the PLA chain (k2 and k3, respectively) with the result that complex 3 catalyzed controlled \u03b5CL ROP/PLA transesterification, providing the formation of lLA/\u03b5CL copolymers that contain mono-lactate fragments separated by short oligo(\u03b5CL) chains. The best results in the synthesis of random lLA/\u03b5CL copolymers were obtained during experiments on transesterification of commercially available PLLA, the applicability of 3/BnOH catalyst in the synthesis of random copolymers of \u03b5CL with methyl glycolide, ethyl ethylene phosphonate and ethyl ethylene phosphate was also demonstrated.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The living anionic copolymerization of styrene (St) and 1,1\u2010diphenylethylene (DPE) derivatives were carried out to investigate how the DPE units are distributed along the polymer chain. Based on the combination of timing sample method and exact characterizations, the sequence determination method was established to reveal the sequential distribution of DPE units along the functionalized chains. In the copolymerization of St and DPE\u2010SiH, when DPE\u2010SiH was excessively fed, a strictly alternating structure can be prepared. As the feed ratios of S/D increased, a gradient structure was obtained. Additionally, when the substituent structure of the DPE derivatives changed, the sequence structure could be regulated. It has been confirmed in the copolymerization of St and DPE\u2010SiH/OMe or DPE\u2010SiH/NMe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, that the electron\u2010donating group (\u2010OMe or \u2010NMe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) was introduced into DPE\u2010SiH. Then, the preliminary sequence regulation method was found. Meanwhile the sequence\u2010determined grafting was investigated, and bottlebrush polymers with sequence\u2010determined branches were successfully synthesized.\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/macp201600420-abs-0001-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p>",

The enzymatic degradability of these polymers was studied in aerobic medium. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of the tacticity and crystallinity of the corresponding polymers on their degree of aerobic biodegradation and on their initial degradation rate. It was shown that the degradation rate value measured for bacterial PHB 100% (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>) was the highest and the degree of aerobic biodegradation reached around 94% after 36 days. A percentage of final biodegradation of about 35% was obtained for predominantly syndiotactic PHB. This result is agreement with the calculated result obtained from triads sequences.

The result of polymerization kinetics showed that the polymerization initiation rate was influenced by the monomer concentration and the polymerization termination was dominated by bimolecular termination and accompanied by unimolecular termination. The activation energy of DMAPMA\u2010C<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>DM copolymerization (89.64\u2009kJ/mol) was smaller than that of DMAPMA\u2010C<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>MVBA (91.65\u2009kJ/mol) copolymerization. The reactivity ratios of DMAPMA and C<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>DM were 0.46 and 15.52, respectively, as well as the reactivity ratios of DMAPMA and C<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>MVBA were 1.19 and 35.77, respectively. These results are meaningful for the oily wastewater flotation and the copolymerization mechanism of DMAPMA\u2010based copolymer.</jats:p>",

The divalent metal salts obtained, except for the Pb salt, have melting points which decrease in the order of Ca &gt; Ba &gt; Mg &gt; Zn &gt; Cd salt. The Zn and Cd salts are fairly soluble in most organic solvents. Therefore, the Zn salt and Cd salt were selected for the copolymerization with MMA, styrene (St), and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). In the copolymerization, the rates of copolymerization increased markedly as the concentration of metal salts increased. Moreover, the systems containing MMA copolymerized more rapidly than those containing St. As for the physical properties of the copolymers obtained, compressive strength and Rockwell hardness were improved by introducing metal salts into the polymers; and heat distortion temperature and tensile and flexural strengths were also improved by selecting the most suitable concentration of metal salts according to the species of metal salts and vinyl monomers. The TGA and the boiling water resistance of the copolymers were also discussed.</jats:p>",

In general, these monomers to the extent of 10 to 90 parts of butadiene yield copolymers roughly equivalent to the standard GR-S which contains approximately 25 parts of styrene. The cinnamic acid-butadiene copolymer has excellent tensile strength. The trans-cinnamonitrile copolymer shows no improvement in oil resistance over GR-S. These cinnamic acid derivatives all enter the growing butadiene copolymer chain somewhat more slowly than does butadiene, so that the copolymers contain a lower percentage of the comonomer than does the charging stock used. Some experiments were conducted on the copolymerization of these cinnamic acid derivatives with other monomers than butadiene, the copolymerization of the furan analogs of the cinnamic acid derivatives, and the copolymerization of \u03b1-cyano-\u03b2-phenylacrylic acid derivatives.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The impacts of hydrogen bonding on polymerization behavior has been of interest for a long time; however, universality and in-depth understanding are still lacking. For the first time, the effect of hydrogen bonding on the classical alternating-type copolymerization of styrene and maleimide was explored. N-phenylmaleimide (N-PMI)/styrene was chosen as a model monomer pair in the presence of hydrogen bonding donor solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), which interacted with N-PMI via hydrogen bonding. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) technique was used to guarantee the \u201cliving\u201d polymerization and thus the homogeneity of chain compositions. In comparison with the polymerization in nonhydrogen bonding donor solvent (toluene), the copolymerization in HFIP exhibited a high rate and a slight deviation from alternating copolymerization tendency. The reactivity ratios of N-PMI and St were revealed to be 0.078 and 0.068, respectively, while the reactivity ratios in toluene were 0.026 and 0.050. These interesting results were reasonably explained by using computer simulations, wherein the steric repulsion and electron induction by the hydrogen bonding between HFIP and NPMI were revealed. This work first elucidated the hydrogen bonding interaction in the classical alternating-type copolymerization, which will enrich the research on hydrogen bonding-induced polymerizations.</jats:p>",

To ensure the uniform composition of the resulting copolymers (telechelic oligodiols), the copolymerization was conducted with incremental feeding of the EO comonomer, which was more reactive in the cationic process. <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR analysis of samples isolated at different stages of the copolymerization indicated that the average composition of the copolymer was indeed nearly constant over the course of the copolymerization. Matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization time\u2010of\u2010flight spectra of the products revealed, however, that for the same degree of polymerization, macromolecules containing different numbers of EO units were present. The observed distribution was compared with the distribution simulated under the assumption that the probability of incorporating a given unit depended only on the feed composition (nearly constant during the copolymerization). With this assumption, a good agreement between the observed and simulated spectra was obtained. This indicated that, even when the optimum conditions for the formation of a uniform copolymer were created, the individual macromolecules differed in composition because of the statistical character of the copolymerization. The results of differential scanning calorimetry analysis were compatible with such a conclusion; two melting peaks appeared on differential scanning calorimetry curves when a sample was heated immediately after fast cooling, and this may indicate the presence of different types of crystallites. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Summary:</jats:bold> We report here on the controlled grafting of defined copolyester chains directly onto the activated surface of MMT nanoplatelets dispersed in apolar medium. More precisely, monomers such as CL and LA were copolymerized, in dilute solution, by the well\u2010known coordination\u2010insertion ring\u2010opening mechanism initiated directly from the clay platelets. This method is based on the use of MMT organo\u2010modified by ammonium cations bearing hydroxyl functions. Using a surfactant mixture that contains varying proportions of hydroxyl\u2010substituted alkyl ammonium and non\u2010functionalized alkylammonium cations for exchanging the initial Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> counterions of the natural clay allows preparing organoclays with a tunable amount of hydroxyl functions on their surface. These hydroxyl functions can then easily be derivatized into aluminium alkoxides in order to initiate the polymerization directly from the surface of clay swollen in an organic solvent like toluene. The resulting activated organo\u2010clays proved to promote efficiently the block copolymerization of CL and LA in solution. The results demonstrate that adjusting the parameters allows to control the process. Indeed, the growing copolyester chains are effectively surface\u2010anchored onto the clay and their average length and grafting density can readily be modulated by the available amount of OH functions on the MMT platelets. These new organic\u2010inorganic nanohybrid materials present nearly exfoliated morphologies and the grafted copolymers display a semi\u2010crystalline and blocky structure as attested by DSC and NMR analyses, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>TEM photograph of the recovered nanohybrid based on poly[CL\u2010<jats:italic>block</jats:italic>\u2010LA] diblock copolyester grafted onto Cloisite\u00ae30B surface.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/jpeg\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.jpg\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>TEM photograph of the recovered nanohybrid based on poly[CL\u2010<jats:italic>block</jats:italic>\u2010LA] diblock copolyester grafted onto Cloisite\u00ae30B surface.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Monitoring and controlling composition drift is an important issue in emulsion copolymerization. Due to the heterogeneity of the polymerization system often combined with nonideal kinetics, predicting copolymer composition and changes in feed composition as a function of time is not straightforward. Therefore, accurate and fast on\u2010line determination of partial conversions of the separate monomers is a key to understanding and controlling the copolymer system studied. For this reason on\u2010line densimetry, resulting in overall weight conversion, is combined with on\u2010line gas chromatography, resulting in the overall ratios of the residual monomer. Combining these two on\u2010line data gives the partial conversion of each monomer as a function of time without the need of an internal standard. The determination of partial conversion of monomers in batch emulsion copolymerization from on\u2010line gas chromatography and on\u2010line densimetry is illustrated for the monomer system methyl acrylate\u2010vinyl acetate. \u00a9 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

It is now possible to predict the behavior of vinyl siloxanes of complex structure in copolymerization reactions with these vinyl monomers. The structure of the vinyl siloxane does not appreciably affect the total rate of copolymerization or its reactivity toward a given organic vinyl monomer. Vinyl siloxane monomers have comparable reactivities to monomers such as vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, and perfluorovinyl chloride but are less reactive than acrylonitrile, styrene, and <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010vinylpyrrolidone. In copolymerization reactions involving vinyl siloxanes the total polymerization rate and the molecular weight of the copolymers are markedly affected by the amount of vinyl siloxanes in the monomer mixture. An increase in the percentage of vinyl siloxane in the monomer mixture results in a decreased polymerization rate and copolymers having lower molecular weights.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Monopotassium dipropylene glycoxide, activated by a 18-crown-6 cation complexing agent (K-DPG/L, where DPG (dipropylene glycol) is a mixture of isomers) was used as an effective initiator of the homopolymerization and copolymerization of several monosubstituted oxiranes, i.e., propylene oxide (PO), 1.2-butylene oxide (BO), and some glycidyl ethers such as allyl, isopropyl, phenyl, and benzyl ones (AGE, IPGE, PGE, and BGE, respectively). The copolymers are novel and can be prospectively used for the fabrication of new thermoplastic or crosslinked polyurethanes. All processes were carried out in homogeneous mild conditions, i.e., tetrahydrofuran solution at room temperature and normal pressure. They resulted in new unimodal macrodiols with Mn = Mcalc in the range of 1500\u20138300, low dispersity Mw/Mn = 1.08\u20131.18 and a chemical structure well defined by several techniques, i.e., MALDI-TOF, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), 13C NMR, and FTIR. Monopotassium salts of homopolyether-diols, i.e., PPO-diol, PBO-diol, and PAGE-diol, appeared to be useful macroinitiators for the preparation of new triblock copolyether-diols by polymerization of glycidyl ethers. In BO/BGE random copolymerization initiated with K-DPG/L, macromolecules of copolyether-diol were exclusively formed. Macromolecules of copolyether-diol accompanied by homopolyether PPO-diol were identified in the PO/PGE system. However, AGE and PGE reacted by giving random copolyether-diol as well as homopolymer-diols, i.e., PAGE-diol and PPGE-diol. Macromolecules of prepared copolyether-diols contain various numbers of mers deriving from comonomers; the kind of comonomer determines the composition of the product. Several prepared homopolyether-diols and copolyether-diols could be useful for the synthesis of new thermoplastic polyurethanes.</jats:p>",

A series of copolymers with varied comonomer incorporation, high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution were obtained at mild conditions. The effects of the insertion of the comonomers on the microstructure, thermal and final mechanical properties were systemically studied by 13C NMR, wide-angle X-ray scattering, DSC and tensile test. Excellent mechanical performances were achieved by tuning the incorporation and chain length of the higher \u03b1-olefins. When the comonomer content reached above 12 mol.%, polypropylene-based elastomers were obtained with high ductility. A combination of excellent elastic recovery and flexibility was achieved for the P/C16 copolymers with about 20 mol.% monomer incorporation. The monomer incorporation and side chain length played a crucial role in determining the mechanical property of the outstanding polypropylene-based elastomers.</jats:p>",

The chosen fluoromonomers were vinylidene fluoride (VDF), 3,3,3-trifluoropropene (TFP), hexafluoropropene (HFP), perfluoromethylvinyl ether (PMVE), chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) and tert-butyl-2-trifluoromethacrylate (MAF-TBE), while the hydrocarbon comonomers were vinylene carbonate (VCA), ethyl vinyl ether (EVE) and 3-isopropenyl-\u03b1,\u03b1-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate (m-TMI). Copolymers of PFP with non-homopolymerizable monomers (HFP, PMVE and MAF-TBE) led to quite low yields, while the introduction of VDF enabled the synthesis of poly(PFP-ter-VDF-ter-M3) terpolymers with improved yields. PFP does not homopolymerize and delays the copolymerizations. All polymers were either amorphous fluoroelastomers or fluorothermoplastics with glass transition temperatures ranging from \u221256 \u00b0C to +59 \u00b0C, and they exhibited good thermal stability in air.</jats:p>",

Besides copolymerization in the particles, also copolymerization in the aqueous phase can take place which affects the formation of oligomeric radicals responsible for the entry of radicals into the particles. In describing copolymerization in emulsion polymerization, one can use the normal reactivity ratios in combination with the monomer feed ratios in the phase at hand (either water phase or particle phase). Most of the research works done were focused on the feed ratio of the monomers in the particle phase. This is because of the interest in the final product.  But in case of water\u2010soluble monomers, where significant amount of polymerization already occurs in the water phase, feed ratios of monomers in the water phase have to be known. Even for less water\u2010soluble monomers, the feed ratios in the aqueous phase are important to know, related to entry of radicals. Therefore, to calculate feed ratios in water phase, solubilities of mixtures of monomers in this phase have been measured by using a UV\u2010Vis technique. It is shown that the solubility of one monomer is influenced by the presence of another monomer.</jats:p>",

At first, kinetic studies were performed for the homopolymerizations of both monomers at 160 \u00b0C under microwave irradiation using four initiators. These initiators have the same benzyl\u2010initiating group but different leaving groups, Cl<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>, Br<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>, I<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>, and OTs<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>. The basicity of the leaving group affects the ratio of covalent and cationic propagating species and, thus, the polymerization rate. The observed differences in polymerization rates could be correlated to the concentration of cationic species in the polymerization mixture as determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy. In a next\u2010step, polymerization kinetics were determined for the copolymerizations of EtOx and PhOx with these four initiators. The reactivity ratios for these copolymerizations were calculated from the polymerization rates obtained for the copolymerizations. This approach allows more accurate determination of the copolymerization parameters compared to conventional methods using the composition of single polymers. When benzyl chloride (BCl) was used as an initiator, no copolymers could be obtained because its reactivity is too low for the polymerization of PhOx. With decreasing basicity of the used counterions (Br<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> &gt; I<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> &gt; OTs<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>), the reactivity ratios gradually changed from <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>EtOx</jats:sub> = 10.1 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>PhOx</jats:sub> = 0.30 to <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>EtOx</jats:sub> = 7.9 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>PhOx</jats:sub> = 0.18. However, the large difference in reactivity ratios will lead to the formation of quasi\u2010diblock copolymers in all cases. In conclusion, the used initiator does influence the monomer distribution in the copolymers, but for the investigated system the differences were so small that no difference in the resulting polymer properties is expected. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To reduce redistribution reaction, the lithium\u2010based dianionic initiator (BDMOLiPE) was first used for the copolymerization of the cyclotetrasiloxane monomers without solvent, with dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a promotor.

The results illustrate that the products should belong to block copolymers but not be too perfect because the block copolymers were scrambled to a certain extent during the copolymerization process.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p> \n   Birefringence is caused by orientation of polymer chains during injection   molding or extrusion, and is a large obstacle to optical applications. Transparent zero-birefringence copolymers were successfully synthesized by randomly copolymerizing   two monomers having positive and negative birefringence, respectively. Since the   anisotropic polarization of the negative birefringent monomer units is compensated by   the positive birefringent monomer units on the same polymer chain, the birefringence is   compensated on the length scale of only several monomer units and becomes zero for   any degree of orientation. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was used as the negative   birefringent monomer, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (3FMA) as the positive   birefringent monomer. Poly(MMA-co-3FMA) copolymer synthesized with a   composition of MMA/3FMA=45/55 (wt./wt.) showed no birefringence for any draw   ratio when a sample film was uniaxially heat-drawn to 3.5 times its original length.   The total scattering loss of the zero-birefringence copolymer was 65.9 dB/km, which is   comparable to those of homopolymers. \n   </jats:p>",

Copolymerizing kinetics and different monomer ratio in feeds were conducted to study the apparent monomer reaction rate and reactivity ratios of NVP and C2NVP, which indicated similar reaction rates and predominantly ideal random copolymers for the two monomers. The Tgs of the obtaining P(C2NVP-co-NVP) copolymers significantly corresponded to not only molecular weights MWs but also copolymer compositions. These copolymers presented characteristic lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) behavior. We then studied the cloud points (CPs) of the copolymers with varying MWs and compositions. With different MWs, the CPs were linearly decreased from ca. 51 to 45 \u00b0C. With different compositions, the CPs of the copolymers decreased from ca. 48 to 29 \u00b0C with C2NVP content (i.e., from 60.8 to 89.9 mol %). Fitting the CPs by the theoretical equation, the result illustrated that the introduction of more hydrophobic units of C2NVP suppressed the hydrophilic interaction between the polymer chain and water. We then successfully proceeded the chain extension through the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of \u03b5-caprolactone (CL) to the synthesis of a novel P(C2NVP-co-NVP)-b-PCL amphiphilic block copolymer (Mn,NMR = 14,730 and Mw/Mn = 1.59). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the block copolymer had a value of ca. 1.46 \u00d7 10\u22124 g/L. The block copolymer micelle was traced by dynamic light scattering (DLS), obtaining thermosensitive behaviors with a particle size of ca. 240 nm at 25 \u00b0C and ca. 140 nm at 55 \u00b0C, respectively.</jats:p>",

We investigated the optimum composition for the quaternary catalyst; the character of the catalyst; the reactivity of the four alkylene oxides during homopolymerization and copolymerization; the behavior of ECH, EO, and PO during terpolymerization; and glass transition temperatures of the copolymer and terpolymers. The results showed that the nitrogen\u2010containing electron donors are suitable as the third component, whereas oxygen\u2010containing electron donors are not. Water as the fourth component can increase the molecular weight of the homopolymer and copolymers of ECH. According to the polymerizability of tetrahydrofuran with the quaternary catalyst and the reactivity ratios of the four alkylene oxides, the quaternary catalyst was assumed to be of a coordinated anionic type. The reactivity ratios for these four alkylene oxides were determined to be EO &gt; PO &gt; AGE &gt; ECH. They were verified by terpolymerization of ECH, EO, and PO. The glass transition temperature of the terpolymer exhibits a minimum value at nearly 3:1 molar ratio of PO to EO, when the molar ratio of ECH used is constant at the beginning of terpolymerization. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

In the most thoroughly examined cases with polytetrahydrofuran as the grafted copolymer and silver triflate as the inorganic salt, current data indicate that no unreacted backbone remains and no homopolymer forms.

Catalyst activity was affected by minor variations in the method of preparation and increased during the first few days of storage of the catalyst. Water, alcohols, and ketones acted as catalyst poisons. Technical pentane and crude propylene streams can replace the normally pure materials used in the preparation of the catalyst. Copolymers of butadiene with styrene or \u03b1-methylstyrene were slightly richer in the styrene than the corresponding emulsion copolymers, except when Circosol-2XH was present in the medium. This resulted in polymers less rich in styrene. Attempts to induce cross-linking by incorporation of vinyl crotonate or divinylbenzene into the polymers did not result in a tighter gel. In the polymerization of butadiene, there is a threshold concentration of catalyst below which no reaction occurs and above which the final conversion obtained rises rapidly to 100 per cent with increased catalyst concentration. The lower the concentration of inert diluents in the reaction system, the lower the threshold value. The intrinsic viscosity of the polymer increases as reaction temperature is raised and decreases as conversion proceeds. Intrinsic viscosities over 20 can be otained. In contrast, butadiene-styrene copolymers increase in intrinsic viscosity as conversion is increased and have a lower gel content. The intrinsic viscosity of the copolymers is much lower than for the polybutadiene samples and the catalyst requirement is higher. Polymerization will occur in the presence of butanes and butylenes, hydrocarbon oils such as Circosol-2XH, carbon black, and stearic acid although the catalyst requirements are thereby increased. Incorporation of such materials before or immediately after polymerization markedly improves the processability of the polymers. Physical evaluation of resulting masterbatches has indicated retention of desirable properties.</jats:p>",

Grafting polymerization of methyl methacrylate\u2010co\u2010ethyl acrylate was applied to modify the surface of acid soluble collagen (ASC). The main objective of this work is not only reducing the hydrophilic behavior of collagen on which has been concentrated so far but also successfully showed that the introduced co\u2010monomers onto ASC can alter the thermal behavior of the resulted copolymer. The level of branched copolymer significantly influenced the initial viscosity in studied co\u2010monomer feed ratios. The graft polymerization of collagen demonstrated the meaningful change in conductivity value of branched copolymer, where the copolymer in side chain with low dielectric constant covalently bonded onto the ASC. The increase in the co\u2010monomer feed ratio had no significant effect on conductivity value of copolymer, afterwards. The novelty of this work was determined to achieve the new copolymer onto the backbone of collagen to be used in specific thermally stabled end uses that the sufficient chain entanglements improve the flexibility of final product.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p> Tetrahydrofuran and propylene oxide were copolymerized in the presence of the catalyst boron fluoride ethyl ether, and various co-catalysts, such as 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, and 1,4-butanediol. Ethylene chloride was used as a solvent and as an internal reference for analytical purposes. Reactions were carried out at 0 \u00b0C and at atmospheric pressure. Monomer concentrations were determined by vapor phase chromatography, and copolymer molecular structure analyses were carried out by physical and chemical methods including infrared spectroscopy, vapor pressure osmometry, hydroxyl end-group analysis, and chemical reduction of unsaturated linkages.The homopolymerization of tetrahydrofuran did not take place, whereas that of propylene oxide proceeded at a rapid rate. In the copolymerization of tetrahydrofuran with propylene oxide, the rate of disappearance of tetrahydrofuran was found to be independent of its concentration, but varied directly with the concentration of propylene oxide. Under similar conditions, the rate of disappearance of propylene oxide was found to be (a) proportional to the square of its concentration, and (b) inversely proportional to the concentration of tetrahydrofuran.Reactivity ratios varied between 1.3 and 1.8 for propylene oxide and between 0.1 and 0.6 for tetrahydrofuran. Molecular weights obtained by vapor pressure osmometry ranged between 460 and 740, and those obtained by hydroxyl end-group analysis ranged between 520 and 1\u2002660. Infrared spectra confirmed the presence of hydroxyl groups and ether linkages in the copolymers prepared. Results on terminal unsaturation were negative. </jats:p>",

In this system the simultaneous presence of a reactive isobutene cation and reactive styrene monomer acting as a chain transfer agent, a situation which cannot be visualized in homopolymerization, was proved to be responsible for giving low molecular weight copolymers. The ratios of rate constant for the monomer transfer reaction from isobutene cation to styrene monomer, a cross\u2013transfer reaction, were determined kinetically. Carrying out the copolymerizations in solvents of different dielectric constant, in solvents of similar dielectric constant but of different solvating power, and with the Wichterle catalyst, and comparing the results with those by homogeneous catalyst, the polar and the nonpolar, possibly solvation effects of the solvent, and the effect of a heterogenity of catalyst on the crosstransfer reaction were investigated. A mechanism for the reaction was proposed. The choice of a comonomer or reaction conditions to minimize the cross\u2010transfer reaction in isobutene copolymerization was discussed in the light of the information about the styrene\u2010type monomer transfer reaction which has been reported previously by the present authors.</jats:p>",

The catalytic system showed high activity for each copolymerization, of which value was independent on the comonomer used and decreased with the increase of the comonomer concentration. The comonomer content of the copolymers obtained also decreased with the increase of the comonomer concentration in each copolymer. The evaluation of the monomer reactivity ratios indicates a preference for the propylene insertion regardless of the last inserted monomer unit in growing polymer chain in all the copolymerizations. The relative reactivity of \u03c9-alkenols was however significantly lower than that of non-polar analogues. These results suggested that the aluminum protection of polar monomer do not affect the activity of copolymerization but significantly decrease the comonomer reactivity.</jats:p>",

The effects of reaction time, AAc monomer concentration and reaction temperature on grafting behavior of AAc were systematically studied. Possible reaction kinetics of plasma\u2010induced graft copolymerization, starting from initial hydroperoxide decomposition, were proposed. Through the Arrhenius analysis about graft copolymerization kinetics of AAc monomers on PET surface, it was revealed that the activation energies of decomposition, propagation and termination were 98.4, 63.5, and 17.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The temperature around 80 \u00b0C was favorable not only for the formation of oxide radicals through the thermal decomposition of hydroperoxide on PET surface but also for the extension of graft copolymer chain through direct polymer grafting. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) grains grafted onto PET surfaces possessed relatively uniform size and both PAAc grain size and surface roughness increased with increasing the grafting degree of AAc. The increase of grain size with increasing grafting degree results from the possibility of forming long chain graft copolymers and their shielding of reactive sites. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The monomer reactivity ratios have been estimated using the Mayo\u2010Lewis terminal model and extended Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f6s equation, being <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>HEMAG</jats:sub> = 1.41 \u00b1 0.06 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MA</jats:sub> = 0.42 \u00b1 0.05. The thermal properties have been examined by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. The glass transition and the thermal degradation temperatures of glycopolymers increase as hydrophilic component decreases. In addition, the solution properties of the water\u2010soluble glycopolymers have been investigated, observing the formation of small micelles. Finally, the potential of these glycopolymers as polymeric surfactants has been proved by the performance of emulsion polymerization of methyl acrylate. The resulting particles are stable and with low polydispersity, decreasing the particle size as the methyl acrylate content increases in the glycopolymer surfactant. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This was achieved by incorporating penultimate effects into the existing complex participation model of Cais, Farmer, Hill, and O'Donnell, using probability theory to derive new copolymer composition and sequence distribution equations that are solely functions of the reactivity ratios, the composition of the comonomer feed, and the equilibrium constant for 1:1 electron donor\u2010acceptor complex formation. The model was applied to experimental data from styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers prepared in methyl ethyl ketone at 50\u00b0C over a wide range of comonomer feed compositions, using nonlinear least\u2010squares curve fitting techniques to determine best estimates of the reactivity ratios.

With the continuous improvement of polyolefin catalysts, high\u2010performance polyolefin materials were synthesized by adjusting the chain microstructure, changing the comonomer type and comonomer insertion amount, among which the ethylene/\u03b1\u2010olefin random copolymer elastomer (POE) and olefin block copolymer elastomer (OBC) are the most famous and well accepted by the market. The excellent properties of POE and OBC first depend on their polymer chain microstructure. The chain microstructure of polyolefins is fundamentally determined by the catalysts, polymerization conditions, comonomer feed policies, and reaction engineering. High\u2010performance ethylene/\u03b1\u2010olefin copolymer elastomers are currently prepared by high\u2010temperature solution polymerization process, which needs to be carried out at a temperature above the melting point of the polymer and is beneficial to speed up the polymerization reaction rate and control the polyolefin chain microstructure. However, the high\u2010temperature solution polymerization process launched more stringent requirements for the olefin coordination polymerization catalyst. Systematic reports on catalysts for high\u2010temperature solution copolymerization of ethylene and \u03b1\u2010olefins are lacking. In this review, we screened some catalysts suitable for the controllable copolymerization and high\u2010temperature solution copolymerization of ethylene/\u03b1\u2010olefin based on the catalyst's heat resistance, copolymerization activity, comonomer insertion ability, molecular weight, and distribution of the copolymer, including traditional Z\u2013N catalysts, metallocene catalysts, and post\u2010metallocene catalysts. And the future development of catalysts for high\u2010temperature solution copolymerization of olefins, catalysts for precise control of polyolefin chain microstructures, and catalysts for olefin copolymerization with polar monomers at high temperature are envisaged.</jats:p>",

On the basis of infrared and NMR spectroscopies of the copolymerization products, it was found that the catalyst systems consisting of Ti(O-n-Bu)4 and alkylaluminums can copolymerize vinyl chloride with ethylene, whereas those consisting of VCl4, VOCl3, Cr(acac)3, Mn(acac)3, or Co(acac)3 and alkylaluminums give polyethylene or a mixture of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene, and are otherwise inactive. Random copolymers were easily obtained by the use of the Ti(O-n-Bu)4-AlEt2Cl and Ti-(O-n-Bu)4-AlEtCl2 catalyst systems. However, with these catalyst systems, polyethylene was obtained, along with a random copolymer, at a high ethylene feed ratio. This fact indicates the existence of two kinds of active sites, responsible to the copolymerization and the ethylene polymerization respectively. The monomer reactivity ratios were found to be r1(vinyl chloride)=2.0 and r2(ethylene)=0.2 for the copolymerization by either the Ti(O-n-Bu)4-AlEt2Cl or the Ti-(O-n-Bu)4-AlEtCl2 catalyst system. The monomer reactivity ratios are not in agreement with those found in the conventional radical copolymerization. Though the copolymerization reaction was completely inhibited upon the addition of radical inhibitors, this does not seem to support a radical polymerization mechanism directly.</jats:p>",

Copolymerization proceeds by Activated Monomer mechanism. LA is consumed preferentially and at the later stages of copolymerization the reaction mixture is enriched with CL. In spite of that, random distribution of both units is observed and end\u2010groups are mainly \uf8ffLA\u2010OH groups and not \uf8ffCL\u2010OH groups. This is explained by the fact that to reach high conversion of both comonomers the relatively long reaction times are required and at those conditions transesterification reaction becomes significant. Thus the microstructure of copolymers and the nature of the end\u2010groups is governed by transesterification rather then by the kinetics of comonomers incorporation. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The thermoplastic poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) containing cross-linked networks was one-pot synthesized by copolymerization of carbon dioxide, propylene oxide (PO), maleic anhydride (MA), and furfuryl glycidyl ether (FGE). The copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. The thermal and dimensional stability of the copolymers were improved. When the MA and FGE load increased from 1 mol% to 4 mol% of PO, the copolymers contained the gel contents of 11.0%\u201326.1% and their yields were about double that of the PPC. The 5% weight-loss degradation temperatures (Td,-5%) and the maximum weight-loss degradation temperatures (Td,max) increased from 149.7\u2013271.3 \u00b0C and from 282.6\u2013288.6 \u00b0C, respectively, corresponding to 217.1 \u00b0C and 239.0 \u00b0C of PPC. Additionally, the hot-set elongation tests showed that the copolymers exhibited elasticity and dimensional stability with the minimum permanent deformation of 6.5% which was far less than that of PPC of 157.2%, while the tensile strengths were a little lower than that of PPC because of the following two conflicting factors, cross-links and flexibility of the units formed by the introduced third monomers, MA and FGE. In brief, we provide a novel method of one-pot synthesis of PPC containing cross-linked networks. According to this idea, the properties would be more extensively regulated by changing the cross-linkable monomers.</jats:p>",

When the S-enantiomer of Ini was used the distribution in copolymer chains at the beginning of polymerization is statistical, with alternacy tendency, changing next through a gradient region to homoblocks of Tmc. However, when R-Ini was used, the product formed was a gradient oligoblock one, with Tmc blocks prevailing at the beginning, changing to Lac blocks dominating at the end part of chains. Initiation of copolymerization with the mixture of both initiator enantiomers (S:R = 6:94) gave a multiblock copolymer of similar features but shorter blocks. Analysis of copolymerization progress required complex analysis of dilatometric data, assuming different molar volume contraction coefficients for units located in different triads.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The anionic ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides, namely of ethylene oxide (EO), with anhydrides (AH) generally produces strictly alternating copolymers. With triethylborane (TEB)-assisted ROCOP of EO with AH, statistical copolymers of high molar mass including ether and ester units could be obtained. In the presence of TEB, the reactivity ratio of EO (rEO), which is normally equal to 0 in its absence, could be progressively raised to values lower than 1 or higher than 1. Conditions were even found to obtain rEO equal or close to 1. Samples of P(EO-co-ester) with minimal compositional drift could be synthesized; upon basic degradation of their ester linkages, these samples afforded poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) diol samples of narrow molar mass distribution. In other cases where rEO were lower or higher than 1, the PEO diol samples eventually isolated after degradation exhibited a broader distribution of molar masses because of the compositional drift of initial P(EO-co-ester) samples.</jats:p>",

The evidence of grafted copolymers was investigated by using FTIR spectroscopy and acid hydrolysis technique. The relationship between grafting efficiency and monomer structure as well as polarity was studied. The experimental results showed that the graft copolymerization is independent of the polarity of the vinyl monomers and that the structures of monomers exhibit a marked influence on the graft copolymerization, namely, the larger the substitute is, the lower the grafting efficiency will be. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Monomer partitioning in emulsion copolymerization plays a key role in determining composition drift and polymerization rates. The combination of recently developed thermodynamically based monomer partitioning relationships with mass balance equations, makes predictions of monomer partitioning in emulsion copolymerizations possible in terms of monomer mole fractions and monomer concentrations in the particle and aqueous phases. Using this approach, the effects of monomer to water ratios and polymer volumes on the monomer mole fraction within the polymer particle phase in a nonpolymerizing system at thermodynamic equilibrium can be determined. Comparison of these monomer partitioning predictions with experiments for the monomer system methyl acrylate\u2014vinyl acetate shows good agreement. Furthermore, composition drift occurring in a polymerizing system as a function of conversion can be predicted if the assumption is made that equilibrium is maintained during reaction. Comparison of predictions with experimental results for emulsion copolymerizations of the monomer systems methyl acrylate\u2014vinyl acetate and methyl acrylate\u2014indene shows good agreement. \u00a9 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Catalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters (lactides, lactones) and cyclic ethylene phosphates is an effective way to process materials with regulated hydrophilicity and controlled biodegradability. Random copolymers of cyclic monomers of different chemical nature are highly attractive due to their high variability of characteristics. Aryloxy-alkoxy complexes of non-toxic metals such as derivatives of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy magnesium (BHT-Mg) complexes are effective coordination catalysts for homopolymerization of all types of traditional ROP monomers. In the present paper, we report the results of density functional theory (DFT) modeling of BHT-Mg-catalyzed copolymerization for lactone/lactide, lactone/ethylene phosphate and lactide/ethylene phosphate mixtures. \u03b5-Caprolactone (\u03b5-CL), l-lactide (l-LA) and methyl ethylene phosphate (MeOEP) were used as examples of monomers in DFT simulations by the Gaussian-09 program package with the B3PW91/DGTZVP basis set. Both binuclear and mononuclear reaction mechanistic concepts have been applied for the calculations of the reaction profiles. The results of calculations predict the possibility of the formation of random copolymers based on l-LA/MeOEP, and substantial hindrance of copolymerization for \u03b5-CL/l-LA and \u03b5-CL/MeOEP pairs. From the mechanistic point of view, the formation of highly stable five-membered chelate by the products of l-LA ring-opening and high donor properties of phosphates are the key factors that rule the reactions. The results of DFT modeling have been confirmed by copolymerization experiments.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>In toluene at 50 \u00b0C, the vinyl addition polymerization of 4-vinyl-cyclohexene (VCH) comonomers with ethylene is investigated using symmetrical metallocene (rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2) combined with borate/TIBA. To demonstrate the polymerizations\u2019 living character, cyclic VCH with linear-exocyclic\u03c0 and endocyclic\u03c0 bonds produces monomodal polymers, but the dispersity (\u0189) was broader. The copolymers obtained can be dissolved in conventional organic solvent and have excellent thermal stability and crystalline temperature (\u0394Hm), and their melting temperature (Tm) varies from 109 to 126 \u00b0C, and \u0394Hm ranges from 80 to 128 (J/g). Secondly, the distribution of polymeric catalysts engaged in polymer chain synthesis and the nature of the dormant state are two of the most essential yet fundamentally unknown aspects. Comprehensive and exhaustive kinetics of E/VCH have shown numerous different kinetic aspects that are interpreted as manifestations of polymeric catalysts or of the instability of several types of active center [Zr]/[C*] fluctuations and formation rates of chain propagation RpE, RpVCH, and propagation rate constants kpE and kpVCH, the quantitative relationship between RpE, RpVCH and kpE, kpVCH and catalyst structures, their constituent polymer Mw, and their reactivity response to the endocyclic and exocyclic bonds of VCH. The kinetic parameters RpE, RpVCH, kpE, and kpVCH, which are the apparent rates for the metallocene-catalyzed E/VCH, RpE, and kpE values, are much more significant than RpVCH and kpVCH at 120 s, RpE and RpVCH 39.63 and 0.78, and the kpE and kpVCH values are 6461 and 93 L/mol\u00b7s, respectively, and minor diffusion barriers are recommended in the early stages. Compared with previously reported PE, RpE and kpE values are 34.2 and 7080 L/mol\u00b7s. VCH increases the RpE in the initial stage, as we are expecting; this means that the exocyclic bond of VCH is more active at the initial level, and that the chain transfer reaction of cyclic internal \u03c0 double is increased with the reaction time. The tp versus Rp, kp, and [Zr]/[C*] fraction count may be fitted to a model that invokes deactivation of growing polymer chains. At tp 120\u2013360 s higher, the incorporation rate of VCH suppresses E insertion, resulting in reduced molecular weight.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Different possibilities for obtaining branched, functional carbonate copolymers are presented in this study. Copolymers were synthesized according to the ring\u2010opening polymerization (ROP) of the cyclic carbonate monomers, containing pendant ester groups. As an example, we chose copolymerization of ethyl 5\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010oxo\u20101,3\u2010dioxane\u20105\u2010carboxylate (MTC\u2010Et) with trimethylene carbonate (TMC), using zinc (II) and lanthanum (III) acetylacetonates as ROP initiators. The transesterification processes of ester groups in pendant, short chains, appearing during conducted copolymerization, led to the establishment of two different fractions: first\u2010branched and high molecular weight fraction and second\u2010linear and low molecular weight. The content of this high\u2010molecular\u2010weight fraction increased with both: the amount of MTC\u2010Et in started reaction mixture and the time of conducted copolymerization. Reactivity constants in studied reaction were determined. It was possible to obtain the copolymer fraction (ca. 30%) with molecular weight of up to a million g/mol, with a highly branched chain microstructure using lanthanum (III) acetylacetonate as initiator. Conclusions were based on detailed NMR analysis, determining microstructure of the copolymer chains and additionally on GPC and DSC measurement. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

With certain polyfunctional compounds this has been found to be the case. Some indication of copolymerization was observed with diethylene, trimethylene, and the butylene glycols and with ricinoleic acid, and solid polymers resulted from the interaction of thiodiglycol with tricarballylic acid, 2,2\u2032\u2010dihydroxydiethyl disulfide (DTG), MTG, and glycerol, respectively. The reactions with the last three hydroxy compounds were studied in detail and the properties of the copolymers produced assessed visually. MTG was found to undergo rapid autocondensation to form brittle solids. Similar polymers were obtained in about 70% yield with small amounts of TG in the reaction mixture; on an increase in the initial TG content, waxy solids, similar to those obtained from TG alone, resulted. As the glycerol content in TG/glycerol mixtures increased up to 40%, the copolymers formed changed from friable gels to brittle solids; any further increase resulted in viscous liquid products only. These results may be attributable to the fact that the reaction is a two\u2010stage one. TG\u2010MTG mixtures were reacted with glycerol with a view to improving the tensile strength of the product. This was successful, and the TG\u2010MTG\u2010glycerol (50:45:4) mixture, when heated at 154\u00b0 for 6.5 hr. gave a white, elastic solid, very difficult to cut or break, which could be milled and pressed although tending to swell in benzene and dichlorodiethyl ether. The properties and structures of these new thioplasts made, where possible, from equimolecular quantities of the monomers, are recorded and compared with those of the commercially available Thiokols. Attempts to copolymerize TG with compounds (I), (II), and (III), which contain the reactive 2\u2010hydroxyethylthio group were unsuccessful.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The cationic statistical copolymerization of n-butyl (be) and 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether (CEVE), is efficiently conducted using bis(\u03b75-cyclopentadienyl)dimethyl zirconium (Cp2ZrMe2) in combination with tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate dimethylanilinum salt [B(C6F5)4]\u2013[Me2NHPh]+, as an initiation system. The reactivity ratios are calculated using both linear graphical and non-linear methods. Structural parameters of the copolymers are obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions and the mean sequence length, which are derived using the monomer reactivity ratios. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the copolymers are measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and the results are compared with predictions based on several theoretical models. The statistical copolymers are further employed as scaffolds for the synthesis of graft copolymers having poly(vinyl ether)s as a backbone and either poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) or poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) as side chains. Both the grafting \u201conto\u201d and the grafting \u201cfrom\u201d methodologies are employed. The reaction sequence is monitored by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), NMR and IR spectroscopies. The advantages and limitations of each approach are thoroughly examined.</jats:p>",

        "Title": "Emergent sequence biasing in step-growth copolymerization: influence of non-bonded interactions and comonomer reactivities",
        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The phase behavior and material properties of copolymers are intrinsically dependent on their primary comonomer sequences. Achieving precise control over monomer sequence in synthetic copolymerizations is challenging, as sequence determination is influenced not only by the reaction conditions and the properties of the reactants, but also by the statistical nature of the copolymerization process itself. Mayo-Lewis reactivity ratios are often used to predict copolymer composition and sequence and are based on ratios of static reactivity constants. However, prior results have demonstrated that in a generic, solution-based step-growth A,B-copolymerization, relatively weak non-bonded attractions between certain monomer pairs induce emergent microphase separations. Such polymerization driven separations lead to deviations from standard kinetics, due to the emergent heterogeneities in reactant concentrations, which can also cause significant shifts in the resulting copolymer sequences. Previously, these effects were observed in systems where the activation energies were equal for all reaction pathways, that is, between all monomer pair combinations. In this work, we explore the combined effects on copolymerization kinetics of differences in both activation energies and non-bonded attractions between monomers and examine the sequences produced within this same step-growth copolymerization model. Our results indicate that altering activation energies influences the kinetics and sequences in a manner that also depends upon the non-bonded attractions, showing that these effects may work in concert or in opposition to one another to bias the sequences formed. Non-standard kinetic behaviors and long-range sequence biasing are observed under certain conditions, and the extent of each clearly shifts as the reaction proceeds. These findings provide insight into the complex interplay between sequence and nascent oligomer phase behavior, highlighting the potential for exploiting emergent phase properties in the informed design of advanced sequence-biased materials.</jats:p>",

In particular, their molecular weight distributions are broader, having polydispersities higher than two, and sometimes their chemical composition distributions may even be bimodal. In our previous publication, we developed a mathematical model to describe the polymerization kinetics and polymer microstructure of ethylene homopolymers made with a supported metallocene catalyst. In this article, we extended that model to also cover the copolymerization of ethylene and 1\u2010hexene with the same supported catalyst. The copolymerizations are performed in parallel semibatch reactors using a metallocene catalyst supported on an inorganic porous carrier. 1\u2010Hexene concentration and polymerization time are the factors changed to investigate this system. Modeling results show that, as for the ethylene homopolymerization case, a three\u2010site model is needed to describe the molecular weight distributions of the copolymers, but their chemical compositions can be described with a single set of reactivity ratios. A single set of parameters is also enough to describe the copolymerization kinetics with this supported catalyst. A new method is also developed and tested to estimate reactivity ratios under composition drift in this article.</jats:p>",

The composition equations and conditional probabilities for monomer succession are identical for enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes, because the steady\u2010state approximation is used in both cases.

Conversely, an \u03b1\u2010methyl vinyl ether (VE) did not copolymerize with BzAs at all, probably due to its high reactivity and unfavorable ketal linkage formations. In addition, a \u03b2,\u03b2\u2010dimethyl VE underwent only cyclotrimerizations because of its larger steric repulsion. The product alternating copolymers, especially those with cyclic units, exhibited improved thermal properties compared to those with simple VEs units.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The \u201ccomonomer effect\u201d is an intriguing kinetic phenomenon in olefin copolymerization that still remains without a detailed explanation. It typically relates to the rate of enhancement undergone in ethylene and propene catalytic polymerization just by adding small fractions of an alpha-olefin. The difficulty lies in the fact that changes caused by the presence of the comonomer in reaction parameters are so conspicuous that it is really difficult to pin down which of them is the primary cause and which ones are side factors with marginal contribution to the phenomenon. Recent investigations point to the modification of the catalyst active sites as the main driving factor. In this work, the comonomer effect in the metallocene copolymerization of propene and 1-nonene is analysed and correlated to the comonomer role in the termination of the chain-growing process. The associated termination mechanisms involved furnish most of chain-free active sites, in which the selective interaction of the comonomer was proposed to trigger the insertion of monomers. A thorough characterisation of chain-end groups by means of the 1H NMR technique allows for detailing of specific transfer processes, ascribed to comonomer insertions, as well as evidencing the influence of the growing chain\u2019s microstructure over the different termination processes available.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An analysis is given of the effect of reactor design on the variation of composition and extent of blocking in anionic copolymerization. Batch, pipeline, continuous stirred tank (CSTR), and recycle reactors are contrasted. Specifically, alkyl lithium\u2010polymerized butadiene\u2013styrene and alkyl sodium\u2010polymerized <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u2010methylstyrene\u2013styrene are contrasted to the products of copolymerization of the same monomers by free\u2010radical mechanism. It is shown for both systems that considerably more extensive blocking occurs in a batch reactor when the anionic polymerization mechanism is used. The free\u2010radical copolymers, unlike the anionic copolymers, exhibit compositional heterogeneity in a batch reactor. Carrying out the polymerization reaction in a pipeline reactor gives results equivalent to the batch reactor if there is plug flow. However, if a parabolic profile exists in the reactor, there will be significantly increased compositional drift in the copolymer product and a broadened molecular weight distribution, with little effect on blocking. Recycle reactors, including the recirculating loop variety, seem effective in decreasing blocking. The extent of blocking may be considerably decreased in a wellmixed continuous stirred tank reactor. However, poor mixing will greatly increase both the extent of blocking and the compositional heterogeneity of the product.</jats:p>",

        "Title": "Template copolymerization near a patterned surface: Computer simulation",
        "Abstract": "<jats:p>We perform a Monte Carlo simulation of irreversible template copolymerization near a chemically heterogeneous surface with a regular distribution of discrete adsorption sites that selectively adsorb from solution one of the two polymerizing monomers and the corresponding chain segments. In the polymerization model, the chain propagation process is simulated by adding individual monomers to the end of growing macroradical. We focus in this paper on the influence of polymerization rate, adsorption energy, and the distance between adsorption sites on the chain conformation and the primary sequence of the resulting two-letter (AB) copolymers and, specifically, on the coupling between polymerization and adsorption. The conditions for the realization of conformation-dependent copolymerization are formulated. For this regime, we observe the formation of a quasiregular copolymer with two types of alternating sections. One of them contains randomly distributed A and B segments. The second one consists mainly of strongly adsorbed A segments. It is found that the average length of the random sections is proportional to the distance between the nearest neighbor adsorption sites. The average length of the A-rich sections is determined by the \u201cadsorption capacity\u201d of adsorption site. By varying the strength of the effective monomer-substrate interaction and the distribution of adsorption sites on the substrate, the copolymers with different surface-induced primary sequences can be designed and synthesized in a controlled fashion.</jats:p>",

It was found that each of the above catalyst systems produces a random copolymer at Al/V molar ratios below 1.5; however, polyethylene is mainly obtained above the ratio of 1.5. With the VO(OEt)3/AlEt3 catalyst system, its good catalyst activity being in contrast with the inactivity of the Ti(O-n-Bu)4/AlEt3 catalyst system, the maximum catalyst activity was observed at the Al/V molar ratio of 0.5. The copolymerization rate decreased with an increase in the ethylene fraction in the monomer mixture, reaching a minimum value at a 80 mol% ethylene feed; however, the rate increased above this feed ratio with a further increase in the ethylene feed. The contamination of a copolymer with polyethylene which has been observed in the copolymerization by the Ti(O-n-Bu)4/AlEt2Cl or AlEtCl2 catalyst system was not observed in the present case. The monomer reactivity ratios for the copolymerization by the VO(OEt)3/AlEt3 catalyst system were found to be r1(vinyl chloride)=2.48 and r2(ethylene)=0.02. The reaction between VO(OEt)3 and AlEt3 was investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy and gasometry, and it was found that the average valency states of the V of the catalyst system is higher than four at the Al/V molar ratio range where a random copolymer is exclusively obtained.</jats:p>",

Diffusion of photogenerated acid in the copolymer films and the acid trapping capability of the basic BCVC units were investigated. The evaporation of acid was also studied by a spectral change of an indicator film that consisted of poly(vinyl alcohol) and tetrabromophenol blue sodium salt. It is found that only acid surviving deactivation by the BCVC units diffuses into unexposed areas and evaporates from the copolymer film. The evaporation of a low molecular weight basic additive is also examined. Whereas the low molecular weight basic additive is evaporated during baking, the basic monomer units in the copolymer are not evaporated at all. Thus, the copolymer with the basic monomer can control the acid diffusion and evaporation effectively. The new resist system enables us to form fine patterns even after a 2 h postexposure delay without any additional treatment.</jats:p>",

The influence of the kind of silsesquioxane and of the copolymerization conditions on the reaction performance and on the properties of the copolymers was studied. In the case of copolymerization of E/POSS-6-3, the positive comonomer effect was observed, which was associated with the influence of POSS-6-3 on transformation of the bimetallic ion pair to the active catalytic species. Functionality of silsesquioxanes and polymerization parameters affected the polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) contents in the copolymers which varied in the range of 1.33\u20137.43 wt %. Tri-alkenyl-silsesquioxanes were incorporated into the polymer chain as pendant groups while the tetra-alkenyl-silsesquioxane derivative could act as a cross-linking agent which was proved by the changes in the contents of unsaturated end groups, by the glass transition temperature values, and by the gel contents (up to 81.3% for E/POSS-10-4).

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most widely used conductive polymers in the growing conductive polymer industry is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), whose main advantages are good thermal and chemical stability, a conjugated backbone, and ease of functionalization. The main drawback of PEDOT for use as wearable electronics is the lack of stretchable and self-healing properties. This can be overcome by grafting PEDOT with flexible side branches. As pure PEDOT is highly stable and grafting would not be possible, a new bromine-functionalized thiophene derivative, 2-(tiophen-3-yl) ethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate (ThBr), was synthesized and copolymerized with EDOT for the synthesis of a poly(EDOT-co-ThBr) ATRP macroinitiator. After the synthesis of the macroinitiator, flexible polymers could be introduced as side branches by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to modify mechanical properties. Before this last synthesis step, the conditions for the synthesis of the ATRP macroinitiator should be investigated, as only functionalized units can function as grafting sites. In this study, nine new copolymers with different monomer ratios were synthesized to investigate the reactivity of each monomer. The ratios used in the different syntheses were ThBr:EDOT = 1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, 1:0.8, 1:1, 0.8:1, 0.6:1, 0.4:1, and 0.2:1. In order to determine the effect of reaction time on the final properties of the polymer, macroinitiator synthesis at a 1:1 ratio was carried out at different time periods: 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The obtained products were characterized by different techniques, and it was found that polymerizations longer than 24 h yielded practically insoluble macroinitiators, thus limiting its further application. Reactivity ratios of both monomers were found to be similar and close to 1, making the copolymerization reaction symmetrical and the obtained macroinitiators almost random copolymers.</jats:p>",

Starch based wood adhesive prepared by in emulsion synthesis have green material, superior property, low cost. The effects of various factors on the graft copolymerization were studied such as reaction time, reaction temperature, initiator concentration as well as match of mixed monomers. By single-factor tests, the optimum graft copolymerization conditions with higher grafting efficiency and grafting percent ratio correspond to the reaction time of 3h, the graft polymerization reaction temperature of about 65\u00b0C, the initiator concentration of 9.7\u00d710-3mol/L, the mixed grafting monomers concentration of 1.0 mol/L, the volume ratio of vinyl acetate to butyl acrylate of 5:5. The starch graft copolymer after purification was characterized, and its properties were determined. IR spectra of graft copolymers indicated that the carbonyl group characteristic absorption peak existed at 1730\uff5e1740cm-1 besides that of starch. The XRD pattern showed there were several dispersion peaks, therefore the graft copolymerization was the concomitant structure of a little crystalline state and amorphous state. TG and DTA curves confirmed the occurrence of graft copolymerization, and showed that the thermal stability of starch copolymer was better than that of pure corn starch. Starch based wood adhesive is white or cream white emulsion paste, excellent emulsive properties and high temperature stability. All properties of starch based wood adhesive can meet the national standard HG/T2727 - 95 of polyvinyl acetate wood adhesive, and the compressive shear strength outdistances the national standard especially.</jats:p>",

The allowable half\u2010life of the initator is a function of the residence time. When all the reactors are equal in volume so that the residence time is the same in each, it can be shown that the incremental conversion in each successive reactor must decrease in a well\u2010ordered manner. As a specific example, a copolymerization is postulated with total polymer concentration restricted to the region where viscosity is manageable with conventional mixing equipment. Under these conditions the relative reactivity ratios are presumed to be constant and temperature can be held within narrow bounds.</jats:p>",

The compressive strength and Brinell Hardness Numbers, determined for untreated and treated wood samples, indicated that the mechanical strength of wood\u2010polymer (copolyrner) was significantly increased in the presence of P(AGE/MMA). At maximum percent conversion, the percentage increase in the compressive strength with regard to the applied force perpendicular to the fibers in spruce was 218%.

Three policies were considered. In the first, both monomers are added under starved conditions. In the second, the reactor is initially chanrged with all of the less reactive monomer plus the amount of the mono reactive monomer needed to initially form a copolymer with the desired composition. Subsequent addition of the remaining monomer is made at a flow rate that ensures the formation of a copolymer of of constant composition. In the third, the initial charge is the same as in the previous case with subsequent addition of the remaining monomer at a constant fed rate. The copolymer composition obtained under starved conditions was almost constant in the cases where low feed rates were used. however, this led to long process times. For the second policy, a mathematical model ws developed to calculated the necessary addition rate of the more reactive monomer, that ensured the production of a copolymer of constant composition. It was found that the resulting process time was one third of that corresponding to the starved process. When variations in a copolymer composition were allowed, the third addition polycy might prove to be a good alternative to the second addition polyce because of iots shorter process time and teh advantage of working with teh constant feed rate.</jats:p>",

The centers differ in two aspects: their ability to incorporate \u03b1\u2010olefin units into copolymer chains (i.e., their reactivity ratios) and the average molecular weights of the polymer chains they produce. The centers of different populations are formed at different rates and have different kinetic stabilities. As a consequence, both the molecular weight distributions of the copolymers and their compositional distributions are relatively broad and change with in time. Two kinds of catalyst poisons were found. The poisons of the first type, arylalkoxysilanes, preferentially deactivate the centers which have the highest ability to copolymerize \u03b1\u2010olefins with ethylene. These poisons decrease the average \u03b1\u2010olefin content in the copolymers and the fraction of their olefin\u2010rich components. The poisons of the second type, conjugated dienes, preferentially deactivate the centers which have the lowest ability to copolymerize \u03b1\u2010olefins with ethylene.

The rate of exhaustion of monomers during copolymerization was measured by gas chromatography. It was established that no homopolymers were formed. The copolymers obtained show a high alkali resistance, indicating a statistical distribution of the ECH in the polymer chain. During the first stages of the copolymerization the ECH is exhausted almost instantaneously, whereas TO is gradually exhausted, finally reaching a certain equilibrium depending both on the quantity of the initial ECH and on the temperature at which the process was carried out. Copolymerization is inhibited at increased ECH levels, and only homopolymerization occurs at a certain critical concentration of ECH.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An approach for the estimation of kinetic parameters in emulsion copolymerization systems is presented. This approach is based on an algorithm for parameter estimation in differential equations and uses the time evolution of the conversions of the monomers in chemically initiated seeded emulsion copolymerizations. The approach is used to estimate the kinetic parameters of a mathematical model useful for predictive work. This mathematical model includes material balances for the monomers, population balances for particles containing <jats:italic>i</jats:italic> radicals and the free radical balance in the aqueous phase. Analysis of the variability of the parameters of the model during polymerization showed changes as large as 18% in the values of the parameters. These values were mainly due to changes in the particle size rather than to a shift in the composition of the reaction mixture. Combination of the present approach with methods for both parameter estimation in emulsion homopolymerization and estimation of reactivity ratios in emulsion copolymerization systems allows a reasonable good estimation of these varying kinetic parameters as constant parameters. Additionally, it was found that when the dependence of the parameters on the particle size was included in the estimation process, the parameters of the model were accurately estimated.</jats:p>",

In the present study, chiral substituted acetylene monomer containing cholic acid group underwent emulsion copolymerizations with an achiral acetylenic monomer in the presence of rhodium catalyst, providing optically active helical copolymer nanoparticles. Synergistic effects were found in the resulting helical copolymers, enabling one certain copolymer to show the maximum CD signal intensity. Moreover, the helicity of the helical copolymers in nanoparticle state was opposite to that in solution state. This is the first demonstration that synergistic effects and helicity inversion simultaneously occurred in helical copolymers prepared by emulsion copolymerization process. To deepen the understanding of the unique phenomena, corresponding solution copolymerization and emulsification process were also investigated. Different from \u201cSergeant and Soldiers rule\u201d approach, the present study provides a new strategy for preparing chirally helical polymer particles by making full use of achiral monomers. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The PAEKBO copolymers behaved in many respects as engineering thermoplastics and could be processed from solution and the melt.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Structure of PAEKBO.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>Structure of PAEKBO.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>This work presents the results of research on the preparation of bioresorbable functional polyestercarbonates containing side carboxyl groups. These copolymers were synthesized in two ways: the classic two-step process involving the copolymerization of l-lactide and a cyclic carbonate containing a blocked side carboxylate group in the form of a benzyl ester (MTC-Bz) and its subsequent deprotection, and a new way involving the one-step copolymerization of l-lactide with this same carbonate, but containing an unprotected carboxyl group (MTC-COOH). Both reactions were carried out under identical conditions in the melt, using a specially selected zinc chelate complex, with Zn[(acac)(L)H2O] (where: L\u2014N-(pyridin-4-ylmethylene) phenylalaninate ligand) as an initiator. The differences in the kinetics of both reactions and their courses were pictured. The reactivity of the MTC-COOH monomer without a blocking group in the studied co-polymerization was much higher, even slightly higher than l-lactide, which allowed the practically complete conversion of the comonomers in a much shorter time. The basic final properties of the obtained copolymers and the microstructures of their chains were determined. The single-step synthesis of biodegradable polyacids was much simpler. Contrary to the conventional method, this made it possible to obtain copolymers containing all carbonate units with carboxyl groups, without even traces of the heavy metals used in the deprotection of the carboxyl groups, the presence of which is known to be very difficult to completely remove from the copolymers obtained in the two-step process.</jats:p>",

Depending on the catalyst, high molecular weight polymers may be obtained in high yields (kinetically controlled regime) or a ring\u2010chain equilibrium is observed upon end\u2010biting, back\u2010biting and transesterification reactions (thermodynamically controlled regime). The polymerizability of the cyclic carbonates is strongly dependent on their structure. Five\u2010membered cycles generally cannot be polymerized, whereas six\u2010membered cycles can be polymerized and copolymerized in an ideal manner. The polymerizability of higher cyclics, in particular when containing aromatic ring systems, is highly dependent on the substitution pattern of the aromatics. Since the active species in the polymerization of aliphatic cyclic carbonates was disclosed to be of alcoholate type, a copolymerization with \u03f5\u2010caprolactone is easily achieved, the reactivity of the cyclic carbonate, however, being by far larger than that of the lactone. On the other hand, the copolymerization with pivalolactone exerts a different behaviour, since the active species of the growing pivalolactone chain after a few steps assumes the character of a carboxylate anion which is unable to promote the ring\u2010opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates. Since carbanionic species may be used as initiators for the ring\u2010opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates, polystyryl, polybutadienyl, and polyisoprenyl anions may be used as initiators to achieve the corresponding block copolymers. To obtain block copolymers with poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks a group transfer polymerization of the respective acrylate has to be performed, followed by the polymerization of the cyclic carbonate. The latter, however, rather proceeds by a metal\u2010 free anionic process than by a group transfer process. The ring\u2010opening polymerization and copolymerization of cyclic carbonates allows the preparation of a broad variety of new polymers with remarkable properties.</jats:p>",

The copolymers were soluble in a basic aqueous solution and in 1\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010pyrrolidinone and dimethyl sulfoxide solvents. The dry electrical conductivity values of the copolymers were measured. The structure and properties of these conducting copolymers in acetonitrile were elucidated with cyclic voltammetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The kinetic course depends on the nature of the solvent. Relative monomer reactivity ratios determined in both solvents show that in <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\u2010heptane styrene is the more reactive monomer, the reverse being true in benzene. It is concluded that the presence of benzene molecules favors the addition of isoprene to the active complex or to the cation. The extremely low value of the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub><jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> product is not believed to indicate the tendency to alternation and is attributed to the special mechanism of cycloaddition. Polymerization of isoprene which leads to an equilibrium stage with low or zero reaction rate can be re\u2010established when styrene is added to the system in equilibrium. In this case formation of block copolymers results. The copolymerization is accompanied by an intensive chain transfer with polymer and the formation of highly crosslinked products. Grafted or crosslinked polymers can also be prepared by the polymerization of isoprene in the presence of polystyrene. Copolymers of isoprene with styrene prepared cationically in benzene are of low molecular weight. Higher amounts of isoprene units in copolymers result in an increase of the melting temperature.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>This research aimed to investigate the copolymerization of ethylene and various 1-olefins. The comonomer lengths were varied from 1-hexene (1-C6) up to 1-octadecene (1-C18) in order to study the effect of comonomer chain length on the activity and properties of the polymer in the metallocene/MAO catalyst system. The results indicated that two distinct cases can be described for the effect of 1-olefin chain length on the activity. Considering the short chain length comonomers, such as 1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-decene, it is obvious that the polymerization activity decreased when the length of comonomer was higher, which is probably due to increased steric hindrance at the catalytic center hindering the insertion of ethylene monomer to the active sites, hence, the polymerization rate decreased. On the contrary, for the longer chain 1-olefins, namely 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene, an increase in the comonomer chain length resulted in better activity due to the opening of the gap aperture between Cp(centroid)-M-Cp-(centroid), which forced the coordination site to open more. This effect facilitated the polymerization of the ethylene monomer at the catalytic sites, and thus, the activity increased. The copolymers obtained were further characterized using thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and 13C-NMR techniques. It could be seen that the melting temperature and comonomer distribution were not affected by the 1-olefin chain length. The polymer crystallinity decreased slightly with increasing comonomer chain length. Moreover, all the synthesized polymers were typical LLDPE having random comonomer distribution.</jats:p>",

The molar compositions of the synthesized copolymers were determined using FTIR and 1H NMR-spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and conductometric titration. It was found that in the radical copolymerization reaction, the DMAPMA monomer was more active than the DADMAC monomer; for this reason, the resulting copolymers were always enriched in the DMAPMA monomers. The study of the influence of the DADMAC\u2013DMAPMA copolymer on structure-formation in the bentonite suspension showed that this copolymer significantly increased the static shear stress (SSS) of the system. In this case, the structure-forming properties of the copolymer depended on the pH of the medium.

The dual catalyst system consists of two ansa-metallocenes, isopropyliden(\u03b75-cyclopentadienyl)(\u03b75-indenyl)zirconium dichloride (1) and isopropyliden(\u03b75-3-methylcyclopentadienyl)(\u03b75-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (2), activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, in presence of TIBA. Values of norbornene content, molecular mass, glass transition temperature, and reactivity ratios r11 and r21 of copolymers prepared in the presence of 1+2 are intermediate between those of reference copolymers. The study of tensile and elastic properties of ethylene-co-norbornene copolymers (poly(E-co-N)s) gave evidence that copolymers were obtained in part through transfer of polymer chains between different transition metal sites. Mechanical properties are clearly different from those expected from a blend of the parent samples and reveal that copolymers obtained in the presence of 1+2 and ZnEt2 consist of a reactor blend of segmented chains produced by exchange from 2 to 1 and 1 to 2 acting as the ideal compatibilizer of chains produced by the chain transfer from 1 to 1, and from 2 to 2.</jats:p>",

Transition metal catalysts, especially late transition metals, have proven to be highly effective in copolymerization processes due to their reduced Lewis acidity and electrophilicity. However, when compared to the significant progress and summary of synthetic methods, there is a distinct lack of a comprehensive summary of mechanistic studies pertaining to the catalytic systems involved in ethylene copolymerization catalyzed by palladium and nickel catalysts. In this review, we have provided a comprehensive summary of the latest developments in mechanistic studies of ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers catalyzed by late-transition-metal complexes. Experimental and computational methods were employed to conduct a detailed investigation of these organic and organometallic systems. It is mainly focused on ligand substitution, changes in binding modes, ethylene/polar monomer insertion, chelate opening, and \u03b2-H elimination. Factors that control the catalytic activity, molecular weight, comonomer incorporation ratios, and branch content are analyzed, these include steric repulsions between ligands and monomers, electronic effects arising from both ligands and monomers, and so on.</jats:p>",

A computer program for performing the calculation on systems with up to 10 components is briefly described. Approximate probabilities for the existence of critical points in ternary and quaternary systems have been evaluated as a function of whether binary critical points exist for pairs of the monomers involved. These data show that, contrary to the widely held view, in systems of three or more components all rij &gt; 1 or all rij &lt; 1is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the existence of a critical point.

Structures and energetics of reactants, \u03c0 complexes, transition states, and products during insertion of ethylene and/or styrene monomers into the catalytic reactive site of the CGCs are analyzed using the software DMOL3. The general gradient approximation correction was applied to the total energy calculation after being calculated at the local density approximation level. The relativistic effective core potential is used for titanium while all other electrons are treated explicitly. Structures at stationary points on the energy profile were generated by minimizing the energy with respect to all the degrees of freedom except for the reaction coordinate which is defined as the distance between the C\u03b1 carbon and the nearest carbon of inserting monomer. The CGC2 with an electron-rich ligand shows a weaker coordination with monomers, resulting in longer Ti\u2013Cp, Ti\u2013Ph, and Ti\u2013C\u03b3 distances and higher energy states. The electron-rich styrene monomer forms a stronger \u03c0 complex than ethylene, whereas the insertion of styrene through the complex into the product suffers a higher energy barrier than the insertion of ethylene. All of the transition states show a typical four-membered ring structure and are stabilized by an \u03b1- or phenyl-agostic interaction. The \u03b3- or phenyl-agostic interaction stabilizes the product. From analysis of the relative energy, it is found that both CGCs yield E\u2013S copolymers with sequences of ethylene blocks separated by styrene. More interestingly, CGC1 shows higher activity for all insertion processes than CGC2, while CGC2 is more effective than CGC1 in producing E\u2013S copolymers with higher composition of styrene.</jats:p>",

Copolyesters were synthesized from the ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of \u03c9-6-hexadecenlactone (HDL) and norbornene (NB) using ruthenium-alkylidene [Ru(Cl2)(=CHPh)(1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)(PCy3)] (Ru1), [Ru(Cl)2(=CHPh)(PCy3)2] (Ru2), and ruthenium-vinylidene [RuCl2(=C=CH(p-C6H4CF3))(PCy3)2] (Ru3) catalysts, respectively, yielding HDL-NB copolymers with different ratios of the monomer HDL in the feed. The activity of N-heterocyclic-carbene (NHC) (Ru1) and phosphine (Ru2 and Ru3) ligands containing ruthenium-carbene catalysts were evaluated in the synthesis of copolymer HDL-NB. The catalysts Ru1 with an NHC ligand showed superior activity and stability over catalysts Ru2 and Ru3 bearing PCy3 ligands. The incorporation of the monomers in the copolymers determined by 1H-NMR spectroscopy was similar to that of the HDL-NB values in the feed. Experiments, at distinct monomer molar ratios, were carried out using the catalysts Ru1\u2013Ru3 to determine the copolymerization reactivity constants by applying the Mayo\u2013Lewis and Fineman\u2013Ross methods. The copolymer distribution under equilibrium conditions was studied by the 13C NMR spectra, indicating that the copolymer HDL-NB is a gradient copolymer. The main factor determining the decrease in melting temperature is the inclusion of norbornene units, indicating that the PNB units permeate trough the HDL chains. The copolymers with different molar ratios [HDL]/[NB] have good thermal stability up to 411 \u00b0C in comparison with the homopolymer PHDL (384 \u00b0C). Further, the stress\u2013strain measurements in tension for these copolymers depicted the appreciable increment in stress values as the NB content increases.</jats:p>",

Results showed that all the starches were successfully grafted with acrylamide then crosslinked by N.N\u2032-methylene-bisacrylamide through this technology.

Upon suitable selection of monomers, polymers with functional groups may be obtained which are eligible to cross\u2010linking reactions or exert a high degree of hydrophilicity. Copolymers with lactones are readily obtained, provided both polymerization reactions follow the same mechanism; the ring\u2010opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates is exclusively initiated by alcoholate ions and not by carboxylate anions. Since butyllithium is a suitable Initiator for the ring\u2010opening anionic polymerization of cyclic carbonates, living vinyl polymers may be used as initiators as well to obtain the respective blockcopolymers. Instead of living vinyl polymers obtained in the conventional manner, using carbanionic Initiators, also living polymers obtained by group transfer polymerization may be used as initiators for the ring\u2010opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates; the mechanism for the latter polymerization, however, then is rather a non\u2010metallic anionic one than a group transfer mechanism.</jats:p>",

Thermodynamic equilibrium is identified as the state at which the growth velocity is vanishing on average and where detailed balance is satisfied. Away from equilibrium, the analytical expression of the thermodynamic entropy production is deduced in terms of the Shannon disorder per monomer in the copolymer sequence. The Mayo-Lewis equation is recovered in the fully irreversible growth regime.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of the anchoring group on the detailed polymerization kinetics was investigated using monomethacryloxy-heptaisobutyl POSS (1M-POSS). This compound was copolymerized with lauryl methacrylate (LM) as the base monomer, at various molar ratios. The process was initiated photochemically. The polymerization kinetics were followed by photo-DSC and photorheology while the polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For comparison, a methacrylate containing the branched siloxy-silane group (TSM) was also studied. It was found that the modifiers with a bulky substituent have a dual effect on the termination process: (i) At low concentrations, they increase the molecular mobility by increasing the free volume fraction, which leads to an acceleration of the termination and slows the polymerization; while (ii) at higher concentrations, they retard molecular motions due to the \u201canchor effect\u201d that suppresses the termination, leading to acceleration of the polymerization. The anchor effect can also be considered from a different point of view: The possibility of anchoring a monomer with a long substituent (LM) around the POSS cage, which can further enhance propagation. These conclusions were derived based on kinetic results, determination of polymerization rate coefficients, and copolymer analysis.</jats:p>",

Glutaraldehyde incorporation and crosslinks introduced upon pretreatment creates gaps or void spaces in the bioprosthetic tissue which serve as nucleation sites for calcification. Calcification can be reduced or prevented by filling these spaces with large molecules capable of acting as space fillers. In the present study efforts have been made to introduce space-fillers substantively into fiber matrix by grafting acrylic monomers, namely methylmethacrylate using ceric ammonium nitrate as the initiator system. The percent grafting, graft efficiency and total conversion for monomer to tissue weight ratio were determined. The formation of graft copolymers was confirmed by infrared spectra, determination of nitrogen, hydroxyproline and arginine contents. </jats:p>",

The application of ionic liquids in sugarcane bagasse biorefinery is gaining increasing interest. The homogeneous modification of sugarcane bagasse by free radical initiated graft copolymerization of acrylate monomers using 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride as solvent was performed. A variety of sugarcane bagasse graft copolymers with different weight percent gain were prepared via adjusting the monomer dosage. FT-IR studies confirmed the success in attaching the poly(acrylate) side chains onto sugarcane bagasse. Oil absorbency studies suggested that the sugarcane bagasse graft copolymers were potential biobased materials for effective treatment of ester-based oils. SEM studies showed that the sugarcane bagasse graft copolymers displayed a dense morphology structure. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the thermal stability of sugarcane bagasse decreased after the homogeneous modification by the graft copolymerization. The present study provides an alternative strategy to convert sugarcane bagasse into a value-added functional biobased material.</jats:p>",

The temperature changes in the polymerizations decreased with the increase of the initial feed ratios of the spiroorthocarbonate monomer. For instance, the temperature in the copolymerization of the equimolar mixture of both of the monomers increased only \u223c1 \u00b0C, whereas that in the homopolymerization of the oxetane monomer increased more than 20 \u00b0C.

However, the intensive transesterification reaction both during the polymerization and at the monomer-starved conditions leads to the redistribution of the monomer sequences and formation of the random copolymer. The synthesized copolymers are characterized by high polydispersity (\u0110 &gt; 2.0), which raises when the reaction mixture was kept under monomer-starved conditions that confirms the occurrence of transesterification. The formation of random copolymer is confirmed by single Tg value, which gradually increased with the increase of the amount of D,L-lactide in the copolymer from \u201348.6 \u00b0C to 33.3 \u00b0C for D,L-lactide/e-caprolactone ratio in copolymer of 20:80 and 90:10 mol/mol, respectively.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a butadiene-isoprene coordination polymerization was initiated by a binary molybdenum (Mo)-based catalytic system consisting of modified MoO2Cl2 as the primary catalyst, triethyl aluminum substituted by m-cresol as the co-catalyst and tris(nonyl phenyl) phosphate (TNPP) as the ligand. The effects of the amount of catalyst and type of co-catalyst were investigated in detail. Experimental results indicated that when the butadiene-isoprene coordination polymerization was initiated by the binary Mo-based catalytic system, the monomer conversion could reach 90%. The resulting butadiene units were primarily based on 1,2-structures, and the reactivity ratios of butadiene and isoprene were 1.13 and 0.31, respectively. The reaction in the catalytic system was attributed to the non-ideal and non-constant ratio copolymerization. When the addition of isoprene monomers was relatively low, the isoprene units on the butadiene-isoprene copolymers were primarily based on the 1,2- and 3,4-structures. Moreover, the orientation of active centers to 1,2- and 3,4-structures gradually decreased with an increase in the addition of isoprene monomers, which resulted in the generation of high vinyl butadiene-isoprene copolymers.</jats:p>",

Compared to the charge neutral homopolymers, it is found that the oxidative disassembly of the charged ampholytic copolymers is up to two times faster and is operative at neutral pH. The strategy is therefore an important addition to the growing field of amphiphilic polythioether containing (macro)molecular building blocks, particularly in view of tuning their oxidation induced disassembly which tends to be notoriously slow and requires high concentrations of reactive oxygen species or acidic reaction media.</jats:p>",

The results were compared with those obtained for the corresponding free copolymerization especially with regard to copolymer composition. In all vinyl monomer systems inclusion copolymerization leads to the same copolymer composition as is found in the free process. On the other hand, in case of the diene system, the copolymer composition of the inclusion products is remarkably different from that of the copolymers formed by the free reaction; the former is always nearly ideal statistic independent of the nature of the host. Inclusion homopolymerization can successfully be carried out with monomers where the free radical polymerization is prevented by allylic inhibition.</jats:p>",

This evolution can be explained by further complexation of lithium with free dialkylmagnesium modifying the nature of the propagating species and/or possible 1,4 to 1,2 isomerization during chain exchanges between lithium and magnesium derivatives. As a result of the transmetallation process, 0.5 to 1 supplementary chains are formed by magnesium depending on the [Mg]/[Li] ratio. In contrast, the <jats:sup><jats:italic>i</jats:italic></jats:sup>Bu<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Al/RLi system does not yield any modification of polybutadiene microstructure, which remains close to the one observed with <jats:italic>s</jats:italic>\u2010BuLi alone.

The most promising bioplastic polylactide (PLA) is already replacing conventional plastics in a number of applications. The properties of PLA, however, do not fit for all potential application areas, but they can be altered by the introduction of comonomers. The copolymerization of lactide (LA) with other lactones like \u03f5\u2010caprolactone (CL) has been established for several years. Nevertheless, controlling copolymerizations remains a challenge due to the high complexity of the system. Copolymerization of LA with other monomer classes is much less investigated, but has the chance to overcome the limitations in material properties that occur when only lactones are used. The crucial factor for all copolymerizations is the catalyst. It dominates the reaction kinetics and determines the resulting microstructure. In this review, copolymerization catalysts for LA are presented divided into catalysts for the synthesis of lactone block copolymers, lactone random copolymers, and multimechanistically synthesized copolymers. The selected catalysts are highlighted either owing to their industrially applicable polymerization conditions or their non\u2010standard mechanism.</jats:p>",

Reaction of these ultrahigh surface\u2010area cellulose fibers with methacrylate chloride (MACl) produced activated surfaces without altering the fiber morphology. Surface methacrylation of these fibers was confirmed by the acquired hydrophobicity (\u03b8<jats:sub>water</jats:sub> = 84\u00b0) as compared to the originally hydrophilic (\u03b8<jats:sub>water</jats:sub> = 56\u00b0) cellulose. Changing the MACl:OH molar ratios could vary the overall DS of methacrylation. The very low overall DS values indicate the surface nature of the methacrylation reaction. At a DS of 0.17, the thermal properties of the surface methacrylated cellulose resemble those of cellulose derivatives at much higher DS values, an unusual behavior of the ultrafine fibers. The methacrylated cellulose could be further copolymerized with vinyl monomers (methyl methacrylate, acrylamide, and <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010isopropylacrylamide) as linear grafts or three\u2010dimensional (3D) networks. The morphology of cellulose fibers and the interfiber pore structure were not altered at 15\u201333% graft levels. This study demonstrates that either linear or 3D networks of vinyl polymers could be efficiently supported on ultrafine cellulose fibrous membranes via surface methacrylation. Through these surface reactions the chemical, thermal, and liquid wetting and absorbent properties of these ultrafine fibrous membranes were significantly altered with no change to the fiber dimensions or interfiber pore morphology. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Graft copolymers, deproteinized natural rubber-graft-polystyrene (DPNR-g-PS) and deproteinized natural rubber-graft-polyacrylonitrile (DPNR-g-PAN), were prepared by the grafting of styrene (St) or acrylonitrile (AN) monomers onto DPNR latex via emulsion copolymerization. Then, ultrafine fully vulcanized powdered natural rubbers (UFPNRs) were produced by electron beam irradiation of the graft copolymers in the presence of di-trimethylolpropane tetra-acrylate (DTMPTA) as a crosslinking agent and, subsequently, a fast spray drying process. The effects of St or AN monomer contents and the radiation doses on the chemical structure, thermal stability, and physical properties of the graft copolymers and UFPNRs were investigated. The results showed that solvent resistance and grafting efficiency of DPNR-g-PS and DPNR-g-PAN were enhanced with increasing monomer content. SEM morphology of the UFPNRs showed separated and much less agglomerated particles with an average size about 6 \u03bcm. Therefore, it is possible that the developed UFPNRs grafted copolymers with good solvent resistance and rather high thermal stability can be used easily as toughening modifiers for polymers and their composites.</jats:p>",

When TOX and 7CC were cationically copolymerized under various feed ratios using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TfOH) as an initiator in nitrobenzene at 30 \u00b0C, 7CC was consumed faster than TOX and the decarboxylation was accompanied to afford the corresponding polyacetal\u2013polycarbonate type copolymers containing poly(oxytetramethylene) units. The copolymer composition could be controlled by the feed ratio of 7CC, whose increase resulted in the high copolymer composition of the 7CC unit. The solubility of the copolymers increased as the increase of the 7CC content. Thermogravimetric, size\u2010exclusion chromatographic, and X\u2010ray analyses of the copolymers suggest that the sequences of the copolymer chains consist of the segments containing the units originated from 7CC and those with TOX unit\u2010rich compositions. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N\u2010 and C\u2010BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N\u2010 and C\u2010BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen\u2010bonding network present in C\u2010 and N\u2010BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet\u2010like pattern, and in the mixtures long\u2010range order is lost. Drop\u2010casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C\u2010BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N\u2010BTAs immediately adopt the sheet\u2010like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C\u2010BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate the copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Summary:</jats:bold> Poly(lactic acid) polymers (PLA) are presently the most attractive compounds in the field of artificial degradable and biodegradable polymers. In order to enlarge the family, and thus the range of accessible properties, stereocopolymers and copolymers with various co\u2010monomers have been synthesized. However, very few are functionalized, i.e. include functional groups attached to the main chains or as part of the side chains. In the search for degradable PLA\u2010type polymers bearing functional groups to serve as intermediates for further chemical modifications, we are exploring two different routes. The first one is copolymerization with a protected hydroxyl\u2010bearing lactide\u2010type monomer, namely 3\u2010(1,2,3,4\u2010tetraoxobutyldiisopropylidene)dioxane\u20102,5\u2010dione. The second route consists of the formation of a carbanionic site in the <jats:italic>\u03b1</jats:italic>\u2010position to intrachain carbonyl functions by using lithium <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010diisopropylamide followed by the coupling of electrophiles. Recent advances in this search are presented using several examples. In particular, it is shown that OH\u2010functionalized PLA\u2010type macromolecules can be made fluorescent by chemical coupling. It is also shown that substituents can be attached to PLA\u2010type macromolecules in solution or to the surface of PLA\u2010based devices selectively.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Example of chemical modifications of hydroxyl\u2010bearing PLA\u2010type polymers derived from gluconic and glycolic acids (via gluconolactone) and lactic acid (via lactide).</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"urn:x-wiley:16165187:media:MABI200300087:gra001\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>Example of chemical modifications of hydroxyl\u2010bearing PLA\u2010type polymers derived from gluconic and glycolic acids (via gluconolactone) and lactic acid (via lactide).</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The direct copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers to produce functional polyolefins continues to be highly appealing due to its simple operation process and controllable product microstructure. Low-cost nickel catalysts have been extensively utilized in academia for the synthesis of polar polyethylenes. However, the development of high-temperature copolymerization catalysts suitable for industrial production conditions remains a significant challenge. Classified by the resultant copolymers, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the research progress in nickel complex catalyzed ethylene-polar monomer copolymerization at elevated temperatures in the past five years. The polymerization results of ethylene\u2013methyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene-tert\u2013butyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene\u2013other fundamental polar monomer copolymers, and ethylene\u2013special polar monomer copolymers are thoroughly summarized. The involved nickel catalysts include the phosphine-phenolate type, bisphosphine-monoxide type, phosphine-carbonyl type, phosphine-benzenamine type, and the phosphine-enolate type. The effective modulation of catalytic activity, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melting point, and polar monomer incorporation ratio by these catalysts is concluded and discussed. It reveals that the optimization of the catalyst system is mainly achieved through the methods of catalyst structure rational design, extra additive introduction, and single-site catalyst heterogenization. As a result, some outstanding catalysts are capable of producing polar polyethylenes that closely resemble commercial products. To achieve industrialization, it is essential to further emphasize the fundamental science of high-temperature copolymerization systems and the application performance of resultant polar polyethylenes.</jats:p>",

In the 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis, the contents of 5H1OSi in the copolymers were found to be in the range of 7.5\u201321.4 mol % depending upon the feed concentration of 5H1OSi. The sequence distributions and calculated reactive ratios (\u03b3E\u03b3P = 1.48\u20133.48) obtained from the 13C NMR spectra revealed that the catalytic system produced highly random ethylene/5H1OSi copolymers.</jats:p>",

This hydrogel was synthesized by two methods for chemical crosslinking, namely crosslinking by radical polymerization and crosslinking by addition reaction. In crosslinking by radical polymerization, graft copolymerization of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) was carried out using ceric ammonium sulfate in presence of <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>N'</jats:italic>,\u2010methylenebisacrylamide, and then mixed with the black liquor resulting from alkaline pulping of rice straw. While, in crosslinking by addition reaction, the same above reagents were mixed with the black liquor in absence of the initiator. The black liquor is an industrial waste resulting from the pulping method and consists of dissolved lignin and carbohydrates. The black liquor causes environmental water pollution due to its dumping into the sea. The formed hydrogels were characterized using FT\u2010IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was noted that the hydrogel prepared by radical polymerization showed high swelling capacity, 60.00%, compared to that prepared by the addition reaction, 27.27%. The hydrogels formed were used also to study the influence of sodium chloride on the absorption capacity at room temperature and swelling ratios at different temperatures and pHs. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this review, the synthesis, the degradation behavior, and the applications of functional polyperoxides are summarized. The alkyl sorbates as the conjugated 1,3\u2010dienes gave a regiospecific alternating copolymer by exclusive 5,4\u2010addition during polymerization and the resulting polyperoxides decomposed by the homolysis of a peroxy linkage followed by successive <jats:italic>\u03b2</jats:italic>\u2010scissions. The preference of 5,4\u2010addition was well rationalized by theoretical calculations. The degradation of the polyperoxides occurred with various stimuli, such as heating, UV irradiation, a redox reaction with amines, and an enzyme reaction. The various functional polyperoxides were synthesized by following two methods, one is the direct copolymerization of functional 1,3\u2010dienes, and the other is the functionalization of the precursor polyperoxides. Water soluble polyperoxides were also prepared, and the LCST behavior and the application to a drug carrier in the drug delivery system were investigated. In order to design various types of degradable polymers and gels we developed a method for the introduction of dienyl groups into the precursor polymers. The resulting dienyl\u2010functionalized polymers were used for the degradable gels. The degradable branched copolymers showed a microphase\u2010separated structure, which changed owing to the degradation of the polyperoxide segments. \u00a9 2009 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this work, {W2} was used for the copolymerization of the aforementioned monomers, yielding statistical poly(norbornene)/poly(norbornadiene) PNBE/PNBD copolymers of high molecular weight and high-cis content. The composition of the polymer chain was estimated by 13C CPMAS NMR data and it was found that the ratio of PNBE/PNBD segments in the polymer chain was relative to the monomer molar ratio in the reaction mixture. The thermal properties of all copolymers were similar, resembled the properties of PNBD homopolymer and indicated a high degree of cross-linking. The morphology of all materials in this study was smooth and non-porous; copolymers with higher PNBE content featured a corrugated morphology. Glass transition temperatures were lower for the copolymers than for the homopolymers, providing a strong indication that those materials featured a branched-shaped structure. This conclusion was further supported by viscosity measurements of copolymers solutions in THF. The molecular structure of those materials can be controlled, potentially leading to well-defined star polymers via the \u201ccore-first\u201d synthesis method. Therefore, {W2} is not only a cost-efficient, practical, highly active, and cis-stereoselective ROMP-initiator, but it can also be used for the synthesis of more complex macromolecular structures.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Cross-linking is an effective way to enhance biodegradable poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) from CO2 and propylene oxide (PO). Cross-linked PPC can be prepared by one-step terpolymerization of multifunctional third monomers with CO2 and PO. However, few such third monomers are available. Each molecule of maleic anhydride oligomer (MAO) contains more than two cyclic anhydride groups. Here, we use it to synthesize PPC with cross-linked networks by adding a small quantity of MAO (0.625\u20135 wt% of PO) in CO2/PO copolymerization that was catalyzed by zinc glutarate. The formation of networks in the prepared copolymers was confirmed by the presence of gel in copolymers combined Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1H NMR, and the improved mechanical properties. The 5% weight-loss degradation temperatures and maximum weight-loss degradation temperatures greatly increase up to 289.8 \u00b0C and 308.8 \u00b0C, respectively, which are remarkably high when compared to those of PPC. The minimum permanent deformation of the copolymers closes to 0, while that of PPC is 173%. The maximum tensile strength of the copolymers is 25.5 MPa higher than that of PPC, reaching 38.4 MPa, and it still has some toughness with the elongation at break of 25%. The above phenomena indicate that MAO that was inserted in PPC chains play a cross-linking role, which results in enhanced thermal stability, dimensional stability, and mechanical strength, comprehensively.</jats:p>",

However, its poor adhesion and low thermal stability limit its use in a wider range of applications. This study proposes a novel method for improving the thermal stability and enhancing the adhesion between Parylene and Si by copolymerizing Parylene C with Parylene F. The successful preparation of Parylene copolymer films containing different ratios of Parylene C and Parylene F was confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and surface energy calculations. The proposed method resulted in the copolymer film having an adhesion 10.4 times stronger than that of the Parylene C homopolymer film. Furthermore, the friction coefficients and cell culture capability of the Parylene copolymer films were tested. The results indicated no degradation compared with the Parylene C homopolymer film. This copolymerization method significantly expands the applications of Parylene materials.</jats:p>",

Because of the introduction of Lys(Z) with a big aromatic ring into the copolymer, the glass\u2010transition temperature gradually increased with increasing feed charge of Lys(Z), and all of the copolymers were amorphous. The copolymers, with weight\u2010average molecular weights from 10,500 to 6900 Da, were obtained and could reach the molecular weight level of poly(lactic acid) modified by Lys(Z) via the ring\u2010opening polymerization of the cyclic intermediates, such as lactide and morpholine\u20102,5\u2010dione. However, a few terminal carboxyl groups might have been deprotected during the polymerization reaction under high temperatures. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2011</jats:p>",

        "Title": "Tuning the Properties of Biodegradable Poly(Butylene Succinate) Via Random and Block Copolymerization",
        "Abstract": "<jats:p>In this mini-review, the effect of random and block copolymerization on crystallization and properties of biodegradable poly(butylene succinate) is outlined. For random copolymerization, the effect of minor co-monomers can be divided into two categories: In most of the cases, the minor co-monomer units will be excluded from the crystal lattice of the major monomer units, which leads to the decreased melting point, lower crystallinity and slower crystallization kinetics. Consequently, the copolymers will be more flexible. Copolymerization with other aliphatic units results in enhanced biodegradation rate, while copolymerization with aromatic units may depress the biodegradation rate. There is an exceptional case, e.g. in poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene fumarate), where the co-monomer units can cocrystallize with the major monomer units in the whole range of copolymer composition, resulting in almost invariant degree of crystallinity. Whether some content of co-monomer units is included in the crystal lattice of the major monomer units or not is still an open question and deserves further study. Furthermore, block copolymerization is an alternative option to tune the properties, which may open a new window for designing biodegradable polymers, especially thermoplastic elastomers. Block and multiblock copolymers combine the properties of the different blocks and the crystallization behavior depends on the block length and miscibility of the blocks. When the block length is large enough, the melting point of such block will not vary much with its content, which is distinctly different from the random copolymers. Incorporation of more hydrophilic blocks, such as aliphatic polyethers will considerably enhance the hydrolytic degradation rate.\u00a0</jats:p>",

It was end-capped with poly(styryl)lithium (PSLi) and then copolymerized with styrene via living anionic polymerization (LAP) in a non-polar solvent at room temperature. The observed side coupling reaction was carefully investigated by end-capping the polymer. Changes in molecular weight support the plausibility of a mechanism involving living anionic species (PSLi or lithiated DPE-end-capped polystyrene, PSDLi) and the alkoxysilyl groups. Through a series of copolymerizations with different feed ratios, the kinetics of the side coupling reaction were also studied. The results showed that the side reactions could be controlled using an excess feed of DPE-SiOEt, a potentially useful strategy for the synthesis and application of well-defined alkoxysilyl-functionalized polymers via LAP.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios were estimated using the Finemann-Ross, inverted Finemann-Ross, and Kelen-T\u00fcdos graphical methods, along with the computer program COPOINT, which evaluates the parameters of binary copolymerizations from comonomer/copolymer composition data by integrating a given copolymerization equation in its differential form. Structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions and the mean sequence length, which were derived using the monomer reactivity ratios. The kinetics of thermal decomposition of the copolymers along with the respective homopolymers was studied by thermogravimetric analysis within the framework of the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Kissinger methodologies. Finally, the effect of triphenylphosphine on the kinetics of copolymerization, the reactivity ratios, and the kinetics of thermal decomposition were examined.</jats:p>",

Exploration of steric and electronic properties of the ancillary ligand by DFT confirm that relative reactivity ratios are mainly determined by the electrophilicity of the metal center. Furthermore, quantitative DFT modeling of propagation barriers that determine polymerization kinetics reveals that electronic effects observed in these catalysts affect relative barriers for insertion and a capture-like transition state (TS).</jats:p>",

Vinyl porphyrin monomers have been synthesized and copolymerized with acrylonitrile through solution polymerization. FT\u2010IR, NMR, UV\u2010vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy are used to characterize the copolymers. Preliminary quantum chemical calculations have also been carried out to reveal the activity of the vinyl porphyrin monomers. Nanofibers with a diameter of around 330 nm are prepared by electrospinning the copolymer solutions. Their morphology and porphyrination are clearly observed by field\u2010emission scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. It is speculated that this type of nanofiber may be a latent support of porphyrins for various purposes such as catalysis, molecular imprinting, sensors, and light/energy conversion.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>The formation of luminescent nanofibers from porphyrinated polymers.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/jpeg\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.jpg\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>The formation of luminescent nanofibers from porphyrinated polymers.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of various artificial copolymers of monolignols and hydroxystilbenes, as well as low-molecular-mass compounds, to obtain the mechanistic insights into their incorporation into the lignin polymer. Integrating the hydroxystilbenes, resveratrol and piceatannol, into monolignol polymerization in vitro, using horseradish peroxidase to generate phenolic radicals, produced synthetic lignins [dehydrogenation polymers (DHPs)]. Copolymerization of hydroxystilbenes with monolignols, especially sinapyl alcohol, by in vitro peroxidases notably improved the reactivity of monolignols and resulted in substantial yields of synthetic lignin polymers. The resulting DHPs were analyzed using two-dimensional NMR and 19 synthesized model compounds to confirm the presence of hydroxystilbene structures in the lignin polymer. The cross-coupled DHPs confirmed both resveratrol and piceatannol as authentic monomers participating in the oxidative radical coupling reactions during polymerization.</jats:p>",

The results of the SEM and TEM revealed that the copolymer nanofibrils obtained had uniform and well\u2010aligned arrays and their diameter and length could be controlled by changing the aspect ratios of the AAO membrane. The results of cyclic voltammetry and IR spectrometry indicated that polypyrrole and polythiophene were both involved in the copolymer.

The influence of the applied polymerization potential on the synthesis of copolymer nanofibrils was investigated.

The grafting parameters such as absorbed dose, temperature, monomer concentration, time, and monomer ratio were varied to control the degree of grafting (DG%). The effect of the reactivity ratio of 4-VP and 1-VIm on the composition and degree of monomer unit alternation in the formed graft copolymer was investigated. The changes in the chemical and physical properties endowed by grafting and subsequent PA acid doping were monitored using analytical instruments. The mechanical properties and proton conductivity of the obtained membrane were evaluated and its performance was tested in H2/O2 fuel cell at 120 \u00b0C under anhydrous and partially wet conditions. The acid doping level was affected by the treatment parameters and enhanced by increasing DG. The proton conductivity was boosted by incorporating the combination of pyridine and imidazole rings originating from the formed basic graft copolymer of 4-VP/1-VIm dominated by 4-VP units in the structure. The proton conductivity showed a strong dependence on the temperature. The membrane demonstrated superior properties compared to its counterpart obtained by grafting 4-VP alone. The membrane also showed a strong potential for application in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) operating at 120 \u00b0C.</jats:p>",

The material composition and the final properties of the copolymers can be easily tailored by controlling the monomers ANI/APPA molar feed ratio. An important influence on the reactivity of monomers has been found with the substituent position in the ring, leading to differences in the properties and size of blocks of each monomer in the polymer. As expected, while 2APPA shows more similarities to ANI, 4APPA is much less reactive. Phosphorus loading of ~5 at% was achieved in the poly(aniline-co-2-aminophenylphosphonic acid) (PANI2APPA) with a 50/50 molar feed ratio. All the resulting copolymers were characterized by different techniques. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) computational calculations suggest that the presence of phosphonic groups in the polymeric chain gives rise to inter- and intra-chain interactions, as well as important steric effects, which induce a slight twist in the substituted PANI structure. Therefore, the physicochemical, electrical, and electrochemical properties are modified and can be suitably controlled.</jats:p>",

An important step toward finely designed nanomaterials with versatile functions, such as those of natural proteins, is intricate topological control over their main chains. Herein, we report the facile one-shot preparation of supramolecular copolymers involving segregated secondary structures. By cooling non-polar solutions containing two monomers that individually afford helically folded and linearly extended secondary structures, we obtain unique nanofibers with coexisting distinct secondary structures. A spectroscopic analysis of the formation process of such topologically chimeric fibers reveals that the monomer composition varies gradually during the polymerization due to the formation of heteromeric hydrogen-bonded intermediates. We further demonstrate the folding of these chimeric fibers by light-induced deformation of the linearly extended segments.</jats:p>",

As a result of the cryolysis active degradation products are formed which are susceptible to further chemical conversion. Products of the cryolytic degradation of starch formed during single and repeated freezing of its solutions (from <jats:italic>t</jats:italic> = \u22124\u00b0 to \u2212195\u00b0C.) with subsequent thawing (to \u22123 to \u22124\u00b0C.) are characterized by enhanced reducing properties, increased iodine numbers, decreased \u03b7<jats:sub><jats:italic>sp</jats:italic></jats:sub> values, the appearance of a water\u2010soluble fraction, a shift in maximum absorption of the iodine complex to shorter wave lengths (from 580\u2013600 m\u03bc to 540\u2013560 m\u03bc) and a twofold increase in hydrolysis rate under the action of mineral acids. This is explained by degradation of the macromolecules and decrease in degree of polydispersity during the repeated freezing and thawing of the solutions or of the moist starch. Prolonged storage of the thawed starch specimens in argon and in air at +20\u00b0C., as well as short heat treatment at +37\u201375\u00b0C. (5\u201330 min., respectively) leads to decrease in the reducing capacity, increase in \u03b7<jats:sub><jats:italic>sp</jats:italic></jats:sub> and to a shift in the absorption maximum of the starch\u2010iodine complex in the longer wave length direction. On adding free radical acceptors to the starch solution no changes in the characteristics are observed. This gives grounds to the assumption that the relations are due to the chemical conversions of macroradicals. Heating the cryolytic degradation products for longer periods in air causes intensification of the hydrolysis. Such hydrolysis does not take place in an atmosphere of the inert gas. Heating under these conditions solutions of starch that had not been subjected to freezing does not cause any changes in the product. The increased reactivity of starch cryolysis products in air is evidently the result of the formation of labile peroxide bonds in the starch macromolecule. The degradation of the initial soluble starch by dilute (0.15\u20130.25%) solutions of its cryolyzate has been experimentally established. In order to elucidate the effect of mechanical rupture of the chains on enzymatic activity experiments were carried out on determination of the activity of the cryolytic degradation products of amylase and pepsin. It has been found that under suitable conditions of freezing and thawing sharp changes in the enzymatic activity during storage are brought about. In contrast with the enzymes not subjected to this action the activity of the cryolyzed enzymes increases and in a number of cases exceeds that of the original preparations. The radical concept of degradation of starch and other polymers gave grounds for carrying out the block copolymerization of mixtures of polymers in solutions or in the presence of moisture by the method of repeated freezing and thawing in an inert gas atmosphere. The formation of block copolymers has been demonstrated on the example of the freezing of finely dispersed polystyrene emulsions as well as styrene monomer in starch solution with varying ratios of the components. A study of the resultant products showed that under the chosen conditions block copolymers of nonpolar polystyrene blocks and polar starch blocks are formed.</jats:p>",

We herein show an example of such molecular recognition-controlled kinetic assembly/disassembly processes within artificial supramolecular polymer systems using six-membered hydrogen-bonded supramolecular complexes (rosettes). Electron-rich and poor monomers are prepared that kinetically coassemble through a temperature-controlled protocol into amorphous coaggregates comprising a diverse mixture of rosettes. Over days, the electrostatic interaction between two monomers induces an integrative self-sorting of rosettes. While the electron-rich monomer inherently forms toroidal homopolymers, the additional electrostatic interaction that can also guide rosette association allows helicoidal growth of supramolecular copolymers that are comprised of an alternating array of two monomers. Upon heating, the helicoidal copolymers undergo a catastrophic transition into amorphous coaggregates via entropy-driven randomization of the monomers in the rosette.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Disulfide bonds are dynamic covalent bonds, which are easy to cleave and reform upon chemical stimulus. Various methods including the oxidative coupling of thiols and polymerization of disulfide-containing monomers have been developed for the synthesis of poly(disulfide)s. However, installing small amounts of disulfide units in the main chain of polyolefins has received much less attention. Herein, we report a novel strategy for incorporating cleavable disulfide units into the backbone of polyolefins using commercially available diallyl disulfide (DADS) as a comonomer via metathesis copolymerization. The copolymerization of diallyl disulfide with cyclooctene occurred using the second-generation Grubbs catalyst under mild conditions, allowing for the synthesis of copolymers with adjustable disulfide content ranging from 0.7 to 8.5 mol%, and the molecular weight of the obtained copolymers ranged from 5.8 kg\u00b7mol\u22121 to 42.8 kg\u00b7mol\u22121. The resulting polyolefins with disulfide insertion retained excellent thermal processability and exhibited degradability. Treatment of the copolymer (8.5 mol% disulfide content) with tri-n-butylphosphine resulted in a significant reduction in molecular weight from 5.8 kg\u00b7mol\u22121 to 1.6 kg\u00b7mol\u22121. Successful copolymerization with diallyl disulfide provides a convenient and effective method for obtaining degradable polyolefins.</jats:p>",

This was done through the electrochemical copolymerization of aniline with either 2- or 4-aminophenylphosphonic acid. Stable, electroactive polymers were obtained after the oxidation of the monomers up to 1.35 V (reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results revealed that the position of the phosphonic group in the aromatic ring of the monomer affected the amount of phosphorus incorporated into the copolymer. In addition, the redox transitions of the copolymers were examined by in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and it was concluded that their electroactive structures were analogous to those of PANI. From the APPA monomers it was possible to synthesize, in a controlled manner, polymeric materials with significant amounts of phosphorus in their structure through copolymerization with PANI.</jats:p>",

When two independent molecules collide in solution or in the gas phase, there is in principle no geometrical restriction on interactions between their orbitals, apart from any imposed by their intrinsic symmetries. Through-space interactions between two orbitals on the same molecule, on the other hand, are subject to the geometric constraints imposed by its structure. In the trivial case, we do not expect two groups to react with each other if they are on opposite faces of a rigid ring-system because the molecular geometry keeps them apart. Even when the groups concerned can get close, apparently within easy bond-forming distance, stereoelectronic effects may effectively prohibit reaction. Through-bond interactions also lead to many important reactions; these interactions are very clearly under stereoelectronic control.</p>",

However, in actual production and application, there are still many challenges for organic photovoltaic devices, and one of the important strategies for facilitating industrialization is reducing the cost of materials. The benzodithiophene (BDT)\u2013benzodithiophenedione (BDD) binary copolymer donor material has good photovoltaic performance. However, the high cost of BDD monomer limits its industrialization. In contrast, lower\u2010cost benzotriazole (BTA) monomers have an enormous potential to solve this problem. Therefore, this paper reports the synthesis of ternary copolymers by adding BTA units into BDT\u2013BDD copolymer with two different acceptor units. It is found that such a strategy can effectively reduce the cost of BDT\u2013BDD polymer, and increasing the content of BTA units in the polymer to reduce the content of expensive BDD units can still retain the excellent photovoltaic properties of the BDT\u2013BDD polymer. When only 20\u2009mol% of BDD units remained, the bulk heterojunction structure with the synthesized donor polymer and acceptor ITIC can achieve an open circuit voltage of 0.913\u2009V with a short circuit current of 16.87\u2009mA\u2009cm<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> and 9.12% maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency, and the material is much cheaper than BDT\u2013BDD polymer, in terms of structural units. Therefore, the results show that the addition of BTA can effectively reduce the material cost (<jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> BDD only) while retaining the good photovoltaic properties of the material, and has a certain guiding effect on the commercialization of organic solar cells. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Sequential energy transfer is ubiquitous in natural light harvesting systems to make full use of solar energy. Although various artificial systems have been developed with the biomimetic sequential energy transfer character, most of them exhibit the overall energy transfer efficiency lower than 70% due to the disordered organization of donor/acceptor chromophores. Herein a sequential energy transfer system is constructed via supramolecular copolymerization of \u03c3-platinated (hetero)acenes, by taking inspiration from the natural light harvesting of green photosynthetic bacteria. The absorption and emission transitions of the three designed \u03c3-platinated (hetero)acenes range from visible to NIR region through structural variation. Structural similarity of these monomers faciliates supramolecular copolymerization in apolar media via the nucleation-elongation mechanism. The resulting supramolecular copolymers display long diffusion length of excitation energy (&gt; 200 donor units) and high exciton migration rates (~10<jats:sup>14\u2009</jats:sup>L\u2009mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>), leading to an overall sequential energy transfer efficiency of 87.4% for the ternary copolymers. The superior properties originate from the dense packing of \u03c3-platinated (hetero)acene monomers in supramolecular copolymers, mimicking the aggregation mode of bacteriochlorophyll pigments in green photosynthetic bacteria. Overall, directional supramolecular copolymerization of donor/acceptor chromophores with high energy transfer efficiency would provide new avenues toward artificial photosynthesis applications.</jats:p>",

It was determined that perfluoropolyether (PFPE) was uniformly distributed on the surface of the Al NPs with no obvious agglomeration by micro-structure analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), microcomputer automatic calorimeter (MAC), and combustion and ignition experiments were performed for varying percentages of PFPE blended with Al NPs to examine the reaction kinetics and combustion performance. It was revealed that the oxidation mechanism of PFPE-functionalized Al NPs at a slow heating rate was regulated by the reaction interface Fuel-Oxidizer ratio. Due to the enlarged Fuel-Oxidizer contact surface area, fluorine atoms could adequately decompose the inert alumina shell surrounding the Al NPs, optimizing the combustion process of Al NPs. The analytical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern results confirmed the existence of aluminum trifluoride in combustion products, providing insights into the oxidation mechanism of Al NPs. The obtained results indicated that PFPE participated in the oxidation of Al NPs and improved the overall reactivity of Al NPs.</jats:p>",

Here we devise a bioinspired, catassembly-like isothermal chain-growth approach to copolymerize DNA hairpin tiles (DHTs) into nanofilaments with desirable composition, chain length and function. By designing metastable DNA hairpins with shape-defining intramolecular hydrogen bonds, we generate two types of DHT monomers for copolymerization with high cooperativity and low dispersity indexes. Quantitative single-molecule dissection methods reveal that catalytic opening of a DHT motif harbouring a toehold triggers successive branch migration, which autonomously propagates to form copolymers with alternate tile units. We find that these shape-defined supramolecular nanostructures become substrates for efficient endocytosis by living mammalian cells in a stiffness-dependent manner. Hence, this catassembly-like in-vitro reconstruction approach provides clues for understanding structure-function relationship of biological filaments under physiological and pathological conditions.</jats:p>",

        "Title": "The Effect of Combustion Phase According to the Premixed Ethanol Ratio Based on the Same Total Lower Heating Value on the Formation and Oxidation of Exhaust Emissions in a Reactivity-Controlled Compression Ignition Engine",
        "Abstract": "<jats:p>A compression ignition engine generates power by using the auto-ignition characteristics of fuel injected into the cylinder. Although it has high fuel efficiency, it discharges a lot of exhaust emissions such as NOX and PM. Therefore, there is much ongoing research aiming to reduce the exhaust emissions by using the technologies applied in this regard, such as PCCI, HCCI, etc. However, these methods still discharge large exhaust emissions. The RCCI method, which combines the spark ignition method and compression ignition method, is attracting attention. So, in this work, the objective of this study is to numerically investigate the effect of combustion phase according to the premixed ethanol ratio based on the same total heating value in-cylinder by changing the initial air composition on the formation and oxidation of exhaust emissions in the RCCI engine. The heating value of the premixed ethanol ratio varied from 0% to 40% based on the same total lower heating value in-cylinder in steps of 10%. It was assumed that the ethanol introduced into the cylinder through the premixing chamber was evaporated, and the initial air composition in the cylinder was changed and set. It was revealed that when the premixed ratio based on the same total lower heating value was increased, the introduced fuel amount into the crevice volume with advancing the start of energizing timing was decreased, which increased the peak cylinder pressure. In addition, the ignition delay was also longer due to the low cylinder temperature by the evaporation latent heat of the ethanol, which reduced the compression loss, so the IMEP value was increased. The rich equivalence ratio had a narrow distribution in the cylinder, which caused a reduction in cylinder temperature, so the NO formation amount was reduced. The ISCO value increased the increase in premixed ethanol ratio based on the same total lower heating value in-cylinder because the flame propagation of ethanol by combustion of diesel did not work well, and the CO formed by combustion was slowly oxidized due to the cylinder\u2019s low temperature as a result of the evaporation latent heat of ethanol. From these results, the optimal operating conditions for simultaneously reducing the exhaust emissions and improving the combustion performance were judged such that the start of energizing timing was BTDC 23 deg, and the premixed ethanol ratio based on the same total lower heating value in-cylinder was 40%.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Geopolymer concrete is a useful alternative construction material for bridge deck systems, as it is characterized by a low carbon footprint, rapid setting, quick strength development, low cost, freeze-thaw resistance, low shrinkage, and sulphate and corrosion resistance. Heat curing enhances the mechanical properties of geopolymer materials (GPM), but it is not suitable for large structures, as it affects construction activities and increases energy consumption. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of preheated sand at varying temperatures on GPM compressive strength (Cs), the influence of Na2SiO3 (sodium silicate)-to-NaOH (sodium hydroxide\u201410 molar concentration), and fly ash-to-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) ratios on the workability, setting time, and mechanical strength properties of high-performance GPM. The results indicate that a mix design with preheated sand improved the Cs of the GPM compared to sand at room temperature (25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C). This was caused by the heat energy increasing the kinetics of the polymerization reaction under similar curing conditions and with a similar curing period and fly ash-to-GGBS quantity. Additionally, 110 \u00b0C was shown to be the optimal preheated sand temperature in terms of enhancing the Cs of the GPM. A Cs of 52.56 MPa was achieved after three hours of hot oven curing at a constant temperature of 50 \u00b0C. GGBS in the geopolymer paste increased the mechanical and microstructure properties of the GPM as a result of different formations of crystalline calcium silicate (C-S-H) gel. The synthesis of C-S-H and amorphous gel in the Na2SiO3 (SS) and NaOH (SH) solution increased the Cs of the GPM. We conclude that a Na2SiO3-to-NaOH ratio (SS-to-SH) of 5% was optimal in terms of enhancing the Cs of the GPM for sand preheated at 110 \u00b0C. Additionally, as the quantity of ground GGBS in the geopolymer paste increased, the thermal resistance of the GPM was significantly reduced.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays, most of the world\u2019s palm oil is being produced in Malaysia and Indonesia; however, the demand for this vegetable oil as an edible oil is declining in many countries since consuming palm oil in excess can result in serious health problems. Consequently, finding new applications such as the production of bio-based polymers to make use of this cheap and abundant vegetable oil seems necessary. Herein, we report the copolymerization of palm oil with sulfur with different feed ratios via inverse vulcanization. The copolymers are then characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results confirmed the formation of the polymers and their stability against depolymerization. Altogether, the obtained sulfur-palm oil copolymers showed great properties such as thermal stability up to 230\u00b0C under a nitrogen atmosphere and rubbery properties at room temperature. Although the Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) thermograms had previously confirmed the high conversion of elemental sulfur into the polymeric structure by comparing the initial sulfur content and the final polysulfide content in the polymer, some unreacted elemental sulfur was also observed in the final product. Sulfur-palm oil (S-Palm oil) is a new green polymer that helps to find a new use for palm oil as a big industry as well as sulfur which is underutilized and left in stockpile as a byproduct in gas and petroleum refineries. </jats:p>",

The emissions and the associated soot reactivity are compared between conventional fossil diesel fuel and the regeneratively produced paraffinic diesel fuel HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oils). All investigations were carried out on a single-cylinder engine and the gaseous and particulate emissions were recorded. Additionally, the collected engine out soot samples were analyzed by thermogravimetric balance (thermogravimetric analysis\u2009=\u2009TGA) to determine the reactivity of the soot. Regardless of the set engine operating point, it was shown that the particulate mass is significantly reduced when operating with HVO compared to fossil diesel fuel. Other gaseous emissions are also minimally lower compared to fossil diesel. In contrast, however, the HVO fuel has an increased number of particles due to smaller particles. The variation of the engine operating parameters showed the same tendencies with regard to soot reactivity, regardless of the fuel used. However, the parameter variations were more or less pronounced depending on the respective fuel. It is particularly noticeable that the reactivity of soot, which is produced when using HVO, is reduced at every operating point despite the lower particulate mass compared to fossil diesel fuel.</jats:p>",

Here we showed that the cerebrovascular responses to brief breath hold epochs were coupled not only with increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), but also with a decrease in partial pressure of oxygen (PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). We used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to evaluate the CBF changes during breath holding by measuring the cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral arteries, a pair of cerebral arteries that supply most parts of the brain. The regional CBF changes during breath hold epochs were mapped with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes as surrogate of CBF changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Given the interdependence of the dynamic changes between PCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, we found that the breath-by-breath O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exchange ratio (bER), namely the ratio of changes in PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (\u0394PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) to changes in PCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (\u0394PCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) between end inspiration and end expiration, was superior to either \u0394PO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or \u0394PCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> alone in coupling with the changes of CBFv and BOLD signals under breath hold challenge. The regional cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) results derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on bER under breath hold challenge resembled those derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on end-tidal partial pressure of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (P<jats:sub>ET</jats:sub>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) under exogenous CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> challenge. Our findings provide a novel insight on the potential of using bER to better quantify CVR changes under breath hold challenge, although the physiological mechanisms of cerebrovascular changes underlying breath hold and exogenous CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> challenges are potentially different.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Calculations were performed using MOCUP, which includes the use of MCNP for neutron transport and ORIGEN for depletion. The MOCUP calculations were done using a unit cell (pin cell) model, where the ThO2 varied from 65\u201375wt% and the UO2 varied from 25\u201335wt%. The fission products and actinides being tracked in the calculations account for &amp;gt;97% of the parasitic captures in the fuel. The fuel pin was surrounded by four reflecting planes, where typical parameters were used for a 17\u00d717 PWR assembly. The hydrogen to heavy metal ratio (H/HM) was varied by increasing or decreasing the water density in the cell. The results show that the drier lattices have insufficient reactivity due to the limited enrichment of the uranium. However, a slightly wetter lattice will increase the reactivity-limited burnup by 26% for the 25% UO2 \u2013 75% ThO2, and 19% for the 35% UO2 \u2013 65% ThO2 as compared to the standard coolant density. This is appears to be consistent with similar studies done with all-uranium lattices, where advantages are gained by hardening or further softening the neutron spectrum. Although some advantage is gained by softening the spectrum, the same can be said of all-uranium fueled cores. The spectral changes and, to a lesser extent, competing resonances between the 238U and bred-in 233U appear to hamper advantages in the conversion of thorium in homogeneous fuel that might otherwise be gained by shifting the neutron spectrum. Physically separating the uranium and thorium (e.g., in micro-heterogeneous and seed-and-blanket arrangements) have been shown alleviate this problem. A change in moderation may further enhance the reactivity-limited burnup of these lattices, and will be the focus of future work.</jats:p>",

Cut-values associated with the highest specificity and sensitivity for 12-month MACE were NLR 5.6, hs-CRP 8 mg/L and OT 302 sec.

Results showed that as the level of stress at work increases, relaxation and physical activity decreases, as well as activity, while emotional reactivity increases. At the same time, the higher the relaxation and physical activity, the higher level of activity and the lower emotional reactivity. Moreover, those two temperament traits can modify the relationship between leisure and workplace stress.</jats:p>",

However, their importance in relation to microvascular function in primary hypertension is not well studied.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Design and method:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We included 71 patients with untreated hypertension (55\u200a\u00b1\u200a13 years, 34% women) but no coronary artery disease, dyslipidaemia, or diabetes. Subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) as a measure of coronary microcirculation was calculated by pulse wave analysis (SphygmoCor). Skin microvascular function was assessed by laser Doppler fluxmetry and local iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and by maximum reactive hyperaemia by local heating. Glucose tolerance was estimated by the triglyceride (TG) glucose index (TyG, ln[fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL) x triglycerides (mg/dL)/2]), and by TG/HDL-C ratio.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Mean office BP was 154/93 mmHg, fasting LDL-C, HDL-C and TG 3.48\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.92, 1.40\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.40 and 1.16\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.86\u200ammol/L, respectively. Mean glucose was 5.40\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.55\u200ammol/L, TyG 6.74\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.59, and median TG/HDL-C ratio 0.65 [0.43\u20131.18]. SEVR (mean 169\u200a\u00b1\u200a29%) was inversely related to LDL (r\u200a=\u200a\u20130.25; P\u200a=\u200a0.041), but not to HDL-C (r\u200a=\u200a\u20130.05; P\u200a=\u200a0.69). SEVR did not relate to TyG or TG/HDL-C ratio. Ach peak flux increase (mean 483\u200a\u00b1\u200a380%) was related to HDL-C (r\u200a=\u200a0.28, P\u200a=\u200a0.021), whereas SNP (679\u200a\u00b1\u200a395%) and heat induced maximum reactive hyperaemia (906\u200a\u00b1\u200a491%) peak flux increase did not. Ach peak flux increase tended to relate inversely to TyG (r\u200a=\u200a\u20130.22, P\u200a=\u200a0.069) and to TG/HDL-C ratio (r\u200a=\u200a\u20130.19, P\u200a=\u200a0.12), while responses to SNP and local heating did not.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Different mechanisms mediate skin and coronary microvascular dysfunction. In the coronary microcirculation LDL-C was associated with endothelial dysfunction, suggesting atherosclerotic disease to be an important factor, whereas skin microvascular reactivity was reduced by dyslipidaemia with low HDL-C in combination with impaired glucose tolerance. Our results are, in consort with observations in type 2 diabetes and in the metabolic syndrome, and suggest that early signs of skin and coronary microvascular dysfunction can be detected in uncomplicated hypertension and predict different aspects of cardiovascular risk.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Skin test reactivity to hymenoptera venom and venom-specific IgE are important for diagnosing venom allergy and deciding on the appropriate allergen for venom immunotherapy (VIT). Longitudinal data on skin test reactivity during VIT and their correlation with venom-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG are scarce. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We retrospectively analyzed shifts in skin test reactivity and serum levels of venom-specific IgE and IgG in patients allergic to hymenoptera venom before the initiation of VIT with ultrarush therapy and after \u22653 years of VIT. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Fifty-four patients received ultrarush desensitization and subsequent VIT with wasp venom, 26 with honeybee venom, and 8 with both wasp and honeybee venom. Hymenoptera-specific skin test reactivity decreased during VIT in most patients, and became negative in 8% of the wasp-allergic patients and in 25% of the honeybee-allergic patients. Serum levels of venom-specific IgE positively correlated to skin test reactivity before VIT, but did not change significantly during VIT. IgG serum levels and the IgG/IgE ratio increased during VIT in most patients. A high IgG/IgE ratio correlated with low skin test reactivity after \u22653 years of VIT. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The correlation between a high venom-specific IgG/IgE ratio and low skin test reactivity after VIT may be interesting for future investigations that assess its role as a potential marker for VIT efficacy.</jats:p>",
