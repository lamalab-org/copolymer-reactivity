Differing from previous free radical and controlled radical copolymerizations (CRcoP), we found that DMAEMA is preferentially included (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/pola29017-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0887624X:media:pola29017:pola29017-math-0001\"/>and<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/pola29017-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0887624X:media:pola29017:pola29017-math-0002\"/>) in toluene; increasing the solvent polarity decreased the gap between<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>s</jats:sup>. With these data, kMC simulations based on the copolymerization<jats:italic>terminal model</jats:italic>were used to investigate copolymer microstructure, which is not amenable to NMR investigation. kMC simulations evidenced both a gradient\u2010like nature of the copolymers and a somewhat unexpected qualitative change in the probability of finding MMA\u2010rich triads along the chain depending on initial feed composition. An additional DFT analysis suggested the likely formation of a DMAEMA:CuBr:2\u20102\u2032\u2010bipyridine complex, which being involved in the regeneration of reactive radicals from dormant species, is expected to locally increase DMAEMA concentration favoring its addition to the growing chains. The formation of such complex is also supported by<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR experiments. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

The initial copolymerization rate, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>p</jats:sub>, for DMAEM/ST sharply decreases as the content of ST in the monomer mixture increases up to 30 mol% and then attains a steady value.

The glass transition temperatures (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub>) of the copolymers were determined calorimetrically and calculated using Johnston's sequence length method. A linear dependence of <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub> on copolymer composition for both systems is observed: <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub> increases with increasing ST or MMA content.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> Copolymerization reactivity ratios enable the design of high\u2010conversion processes for the production of copolymers of well\u2010defined properties for particular applications, such as the improvement of rheological properties of lubricating mineral oils.

It can be concluded that copolymerization of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MMA</jats:styled-content> with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DPA</jats:styled-content> is ideal while copolymerization of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ST</jats:styled-content> with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DPA</jats:styled-content> has a small but noticeable tendency for block copolymer building. The probabilities for formations of dyad and triad monomer sequences dependent on monomer compositions were calculated from the obtained reactivity ratios. The molar mass distribution, thermal stability and glass transition temperatures of synthesized copolymers were determined. Hydrophobicity of copolymers depending on the composition was determined using contact angle measurements, decreasing from hydrophobic polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) to hydrophilic <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DPA</jats:styled-content>. Copolymerization reactivity ratios are crucial for the control of copolymer structural properties and conversion heterogeneity that greatly influence the applications of copolymers as rheology modifiers of lubricating oils or in drug delivery systems. \u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The crosspropagation of 1\u2010ethylcyclopentyl methacrylate (ECPMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) has been studied using a combination of quantum chemistry calculations and experiment. Our computational work utilizes a trimer\u2010to\u2010tetramer reaction model, coupled with an ONIOM (B3LYP/6\u201031G(2df,p): B3LYP/6\u201031G(d)) method for geometry optimization and an M06\u20102X/6\u2010311+G(2df,p) method plus SMD solvation model for single point energy calculations. The results show several trends: the identity of the ultimate unit of a trimer radical affects not only the preferred conformation of the region where the reaction takes place, but also the reactivity of the radical; the addition of an ECPMA monomer to the radicals is generally favored compared to an MMA monomer; the pen\u2010penultimate unit of a trimer radical shows a nonnegligible entropic effect; the penultimate unit effect is implicit for the ECPMA\u2013MMA copolymer system. Finally, terminal model reactivity ratios fitted based on the explicit rate coefficients calculated from the quantum chemical results are compared with those from experimental measurements. The computations not only agree qualitatively with experimentally derived results in terms of the selectivity of ECPMA\u2013MMA crosspropagation, but also give reasonable quantitative predictions of reactivity ratios.\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mats201500072-abs-0001-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios for these monomers were measured by running a series of reactions at various feed ratios of initial monomers, and the monomer incorporation into copolymer was determined using <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR. Reactivity ratios of the MMA/MTMP system were measured to be <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub></jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.37 and <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub></jats:italic>\u2009=\u20091.14 from extended Kelen\u2010T\u00fcdos method. The results show that monomer MTMP prefers homopolymerization to copolymerization in the system, whereas monomer MMA prefers copolymerization to homopolymerization. Sequence structures of the MMA/MTMP copolymers were characterized using <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR. The results show that the sequence structure for the main chain of the MMA/MTMP copolymers is mainly composed of a syndiotactic configuration, only with a little heterotactic configuration. Three kinds of the sequences of <jats:italic>rr</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>rr</jats:italic>\u2032, and <jats:italic>lr</jats:italic>\u2032 in the syndiotactic configuration are found.

For <jats:italic>f</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.2, the monomer unit of MMA is mostly separated by MTMP units, and for <jats:italic>f</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.6, the alternating tendency prevails and a large number of mono\u2010sequences are formed; further up to <jats:italic>f</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.8, the monomer unit of MTMP with the sequence of one unit is interspersed among the chain of MMA.

Linear dependence of ln[M]<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>/[M] versus time data along with narrow polydispersity of molecular weight distribution revealed that all the homo\u2010 and copolymerization reactions proceed according to the controlled/living characteristic. To obtain more reliable monomer reactivity ratios, the cumulative average copolymer composition at moderate to high conversion was determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectroscopy. Reactivity ratios of St and MA were calculated by the extended Kelen\u2010Tudos (KT) and Mao\u2010Huglin (MH) methods to be <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>St</jats:sub> = 1.018 \u00b1 0.060, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MA</jats:sub> = 0.177 \u00b1 0.025 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>St</jats:sub> = 1.016 \u00b1 0.053, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MA</jats:sub> = 0.179 \u00b1 0.023, respectively, which are in a good agreement with those reported for the conventional free\u2010radical copolymerization of St and MA. Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental composition drifts in the comonomer mixture and copolymer as a function of the overall monomer conversion were observed, indicating that the reactivity ratios calculated by copolymer composition at the moderate to high conversion are accurate. Instantaneous copolymer composition curve and number\u2010average sequence length of comonomers in the copolymer indicated that the copolymerization system tends to produce a random copolymer. However, MA\u2010centered triad distribution results indicate that the spontaneous gradient copolymers can also be obtained when the mole fraction of MA in the initial comonomer mixture is high enough. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The increase in <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub> values with increasing GMA content has been attributed to the cross\u2010termination of MMA\u2013GMA radicals. The transfer constant of TP has also been determined for GMA and found to be 1.00. A MMA\u2013GMA copolymer of low molecular weight, containing 2.01% of oxirane oxygen, was modified by opening of the oxirane ring of GMA by reaction with diethanolamine (DEA). The reaction was carried out at 70 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, the copolymer content of epoxy groups and the amine being assumed to be in the molar ratio of 1:4. Addition of a hydrogen\u2010bond acceptor like nitrobenzene decreases, while addition of a hydrogen\u2010bond donor like phenol increases the rate of epoxy ring opening with DEA. This indicates that a hydrogen\u2010bonded intermediate is involved in this reaction and that it weakens the epoxy ring and enhances the rate of its opening with DEA. From the studies of the conversion rates, existence of a \u201cnonspecific\u201d side reaction has been shown which involves the reaction of the terminal epoxy groups of the copolymer and the hydroxyl groups of DEA or formed in the reaction with DEA (involves a chain coupling). DEA can be trifunctional in this reaction. This has been further confirmed from the increase of number\u2010average molecular weights M\u0304<jats:sub><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sub> of the copolymers resulting from this coupling and the nitrogen content in the copolymers after modification with DEA.</jats:p>",

To know their reactivity in radical copolymerization reactions with methyl methacrylate (MMA), a model monomer (MTm) was synthesized to determine the reactivity ratios and compare them with the low molar fractions of copolymers of MT with MMA because they were difficult to isolate.

The monomers and copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR spectral studies.

The reactivity ratios of the monomers were determined by applying Fineman\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f6s methods. The analysis of reactivity ratios revealed that pMPOEMA and pClPOEMA are less reactive than PAMA is, and copolymers formed are statistically in nature.

Thermogravimetric analysis of the polymers reveals that the thermal stability of the copolymers increases with an increase in the mole fraction of pMPOEMA and pClPOEMA in the copolymers.

The synthesized copolymers were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and their thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The copolymers compositions were determined by elemental analysis. The monomer reactivity ratios have been calculated by linearization methods proposed by Kelen-Tudos and Fineman-Ross. The derived reactivity ratios (r1, r2) for (AM-co-MMA) are: (0.03, 0.593). The microstructure of copolymers and sequence distribution of monomers in the copolymers were calculated by statistical method based on the average reactivity ratios and found that these values are in agreement with the derived reactivity ratios.

By employing the phenyl and benzyl esters of 2\u2010bromo\u20102\u2010methylpropionic acid as the initiators with 2,2\u2010bipyridyl and Cu(I)Cl it has been possible to use high field <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate in some detail the composition and structure of the branched PMMAs obtained. Parallel molar mass size exclusion chromatographic analysis using a multi\u2010angle light scattering detector with a refractive index detector (MALS/SEC) has allowed the branched architecture of the products to be confirmed. Rather remarkably, high yields of branched PMMAs can be obtained without crosslinking using MMA/EGDMA molar feed ratios of up to 5/1 by appropriate adjustment of the molar feed of initiator. In particular by maintaining the EGDMA/initiator molar feed ratio \u223c1/1 fully soluble products can be obtained that are densely branched since this feed ratio ensures that on average each living primary chain initiated contains on average only one branching EGDMA segment. As might be expected this controlled free radical process offers better control in the synthesis of branched polymer than the corresponding system we have reported using conventional free radical polymerization, and unlike the latter which requires the use of a chain transfer agent, the ATRP system requires no additional chain regulating component. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A generally applicable computational procedure, which permits the accurate evaluation of the kinetic parameters of intricate and extended copolymerization schemes to be made, is described. This method is based on a numerical integration of the differential equation, and, according to the (improved) curve\u2010fitting I procedure, experimental errors in both measured variables are considered. Furthermore, a description is given of the<jats:italic>F</jats:italic>test, in which a statistical comparison between the resulting residual sums of squares of two different schemes offers a possibility of selecting the most probable kinetic scheme for a given copolymerization system. The capability and applicability of the methods developed is demonstrated for the free radical copolymerization kinetics of methyl acrylate (MA) (M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and butadiene (BD) (M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) with toluene as solvent. Here, the simple copolymer equation is unsatisfactory because a significant penultimate unit effect in BD macroradical reactivity shows up:<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>222</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>221</jats:sub>= 0.84, and<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>122</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>121</jats:sub>= 0.53, and<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>11</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>12</jats:sub>= 0.088. The microstructure of the copolymer samples, determined by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, shows a decreasing fraction of BD units in the vinyl configuration in favor of the fraction of BD units in the<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>\u2010vinylene and<jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\u2010vinylene configuration at increasing MA (<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>) content. Statistical considerations indicate a strongly diminished probability of finding BD (<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) in the vinyl configuration in \u223c<jats:italic>mb</jats:italic>\u223c transitions. Steric hindrance or polar repulsion of the ester side group of the penultimate MA unit probably account for the increased preference for monomer addition to the C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>site over the C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>site of the BD macroradical.</jats:p>",

A kinetic study of solution copolymerization in DMSO at 30 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C showed that the Py could not initiate copolymerization even after 20 h, whereas with AP as initiator, less than 1% conversion was observed. However, introduction of a Br in \u03b1\u2010methyl group of AP significantly enhanced the percent conversion. The kinetics and mechanism of copolymerization of BA with MMA using BP as photoinitiator have been studied in detail. The system follows nonideal kinetics (R<jats:sub>p</jats:sub>\u2009\u03b1 [BP]<jats:sup>0.67</jats:sup>[BA]<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>[MMA]<jats:sup>0.98</jats:sup>), and degradative solvent transfer reasonably explains these kinetic nonidealities.

The copolymerizations of a variety of monomers, including styrene, acrylates, methacrylates and vinyl acetate, are investigated. In particular, the monomer and radical reactivity ratios for ST/HEMA, ST/GMA, ST/BMA, ST/HEA, MMA/VAc, ST/MMA, and ST/EA are calculated. Good agreement between the computational and experimental results is obtained for comparisons of the determined parameters with the experimental data available in the literature.

Finally, the effect of conversion and therewith composition drift on the catalytic chain transfer polymerization of MMA and BA is investigated and it is shown that under the conditions employed in the experiments a certain degree of macromer copolymerization is present at high partial conversions of MMA.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Evolution of MWD with conversion for the CCT copolymerization of MMA and BA in toluene at 60\u2009\u00b0C, [AIBN]\u2009=\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u200910<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> mol\u2009\u00b7\u2009L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>Evolution of MWD with conversion for the CCT copolymerization of MMA and BA in toluene at 60\u2009\u00b0C, [AIBN]\u2009=\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u200910<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> mol\u2009\u00b7\u2009L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It was reported earlier that the copolymerization of acrylamide and styrene is strongly affected by the copolymerization medium. The effect was attributed to a change in the polarity of the ethylenic bond in the acrylamide monomer due to hydrogen bonding and/or dipole\u2014dipole interaction, depending on the medium. In view of those findings, it was suggested that absolute values for the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of these two monomers might be obtained only when the acrylamide monomer is unperturbed. Copolymerizations of these monomers at a number of ratios, therefore, were done in benzene, which does not undergo hydrogen bonding and has no dipole moment, at high dilution, when amide\u2014amide interactions between acrylamide molecules should be essentially eliminated. The values of <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = acrylamide) were 9.14 \u00b1 0.27 and 0.67 \u00b1 0.08, respectively. There appears to be some indication in this system that high dilution adversely affects the reactivity of the acrylamide monomer while enhancing that of styrene.

In particular, the study analyses the effect of the number of ethylene glycol (EG) groups along the lateral chains of PEGMA and is carried out under fully ionized conditions of MAA at different initial monomer ratios and initial overall monomer concentrations (5\u201320 wt % in aqueous solution). The composition drift with conversion indicates that PEGMA macromonomer is more reactive than MAA. Individual monomer consumption rates show that the rates of consumption of both monomers are not first order with respect to overall concentration of the monomer. The reactivity ratios estimated from the copolymerization kinetics reveal, that for the short PEGMA, the reactivity ratios rMAA and rPEGMA increase with the solids content (SC). A totally different trend is obtained for the longer PEGMA, whose reactivity ratio (rPEGMA23) decreases with solids content, whereas the reactivity ratio of MAA remains roughly constant.</jats:p>",

The copolymerization behavior was studied in different composition with the mole fractions of GMA ranging from 0.20 to 0.80 in the feed and under 10% copolymer conversion. The copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The thermogravimetric analysis of the copolymers suggest an overall decrease in the thermal stability of the copolymer with decreasing content of GMA in the copolymers. Thermal decomposition activation energies are calculated by the Ozawa method. The copolymer composition was determined by the application of elemental analysis method. The monomer reactivity ratios were estimated by the application of conventional linearization methods, such as Kelen\u2013Tudos (K\u2010T), Fineman\u2013Ross (F\u2010R) methods, and a nonlinear error in variable model (RREVM) method using a computer program, and all results were discussed and compared with the literature.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p> The copolymer P(AM-DMC), one kind of cationic polyacrylamide, was synthesized by using acrylamide (AM) and methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC) as monomers with ultraviolet initiation. The copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The composition of the copolymer was determined from the chlorine content by silver nitrate titration. The effects of monomer feed ratio and conversion on the composition of copolymer were discussed. Reactivity ratios were determined by the Fineman-Ross, Kelen-Tudos and Yezrielev-Brokhina-Roskin methods, indicating that their positive order calculation results were very different with those of reverse order, when the reactivity ratios were determined by Fineman-Ross. However, their positive order and reverse order calculation results were similar when the reactivity ratios were determined by the Kelen-Tudos and Yezrielev-Brokhina-Roskin methods. Therefore, the reactivity ratios were determined using the average results of the Kelen-Tudos and Yezrielev-Brokhina-Roskin methods. The reactivity ratios of AM and DMC were 2.3398 and 0.2285, respectively. This result showed that the copolymerization of AM and DMC was a non-ideal random copolymerization. Furthermore, the content of AM segments decreased with the increase of AM feed content, but the content of DMC segments increased. Moreover, the sequence length distribution was irregular and narrow, because AM was prone to homopolymerization. </jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios of these two monomers is similar to that of MMA suggesting that the length of the bromine containing monomers side chain does not affect significantly the reactivity of the methacrylic double bond. From the results we conclude the copolymers to have random structure.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a photoinduced free radical copolymerization of APMP and methyl methacrylate (MMA) is accomplished at ambient temperature in solution. APMP plays a key role in the copolymerization, owing to the nitroxides generated in situ from the moiety of 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-piperidine under UV irradiation, and mediates the copolymerization, which is confirmed by the linear kinetics. With the increment of initial monomer feed ratios of APMP/MMA, both the copolymerization rate and the average molecular weight increase. According to the reactivity ratios from the extended Kelen-T\u00fcdos (KT) method at high conversion by<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy, a nonlinear model is established and the sequential distribution in the copolymers is also investigated. The dispersion of APMP units is regulated by the feed ratios and reactivity ratios.</jats:p>",

It was found that the relative reactivities toward the polystyryl radical were not correlated with the ordinary Hammett equation, but a linear relationship was obtained with a modified Hammett equation which contained a term of the resonance contribution by the substituents.

All reactions presented pseudolinear kinetics. The effect of the monomer feed ratio on the copolymerization kinetics was examined. The conversion level decreased when the proportion of ethyl \u03b1\u2010hydroxymethylacrylate in the monomer feed was larger. Kinetic studies indicated that the radical polymerizations proceeded with apparent living character according to experiments, demonstrating an increase in the molar mass with the monomer conversion and a relatively narrow molar mass distribution. All copolymers were statistical in chain structure, as confirmed by determinations of the monomer reactivity ratios. The monomer reactivity ratios were determined, and the Mayo\u2013Lewis terminal model provided excellent predictions for the variations of the intermolecular structure over the entire conversion range. Additionally, the chemical modification of poly(ethyl \u03b1\u2010hydroxymethylacrylate) was carried out to introduce glucose pendant groups into the structure. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Real time FTIR measurements were performed to monitor the depletion of each comonomer double bond during the isothermal curing reaction at 80\u00b0C. From the experimental data corresponding to different feed compositions, the initial reactivity ratios and their evolution with conversion were determined via a nonlinear least squares optimization of the integrated form of the copolymerization equation. The reactivity ratio of St increases continuously and exponentially with the overall reaction conversion, while that of BDMA decreases linearly. A modified terminal copolymerization model including the dependence of the reactivity ratios with the overall conversion was proposed. The application of this model provides a consistent fitting for the conversion of each comonomer during all reaction stages, even at high conversion values where large diffusion and topological restrictions for chain movements are present. Simulations show that the concentration of styrene units added to the copolymer increases with the overall reaction conversion, while that for the BDMA double bonds diminishes. Structures rich in homopolymerized styrene are predicted at later stages of the reaction.\u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) is an important component of many acrylic resins used in coatings formulations, as the functionality ensures that the chains participate in the cross-linking reactions required to form the final product. Hence, the knowledge of their radical copolymerization kinetic coefficients is vital for both process and recipe improvements. The pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) technique is paired with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide kinetic coefficients for the copolymerization of HEMA with butyl methacrylate (BMA) in various solvents. The choice of solvent has a significant impact on both copolymer composition and on the composition-averaged propagation rate coefficient (kp,cop). Compared to the bulk system, both n-butanol and dimethylformamide reduce the relative reactivity of HEMA during copolymerization, while xylene as a solvent enhances HEMA reactivity. The magnitude of the solvent effect varies with monomer concentration, as shown by a systematic study of monomer/solvent mixtures containing 50 vol%, 20 vol%, and 10 vol% monomer. The observed behavior is related to the influence of hydrogen bonding on monomer reactivity, with the experimental results fit using the terminal model of radical copolymerization to provide estimates of reactivity ratios and kp,HEMA.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With a Monte Carlo simulationmethod, copolymer properties have been thoroughly studied, and the influence of the reactivity ratios and feed composition has been taken into consideration. Instantaneous alterations of the copolymer composition and copolymer heterogeneity, which is also called a randomness parameter, have been examined with data obtained from the simulation at each stage of the copolymerization reaction. The results prove the azeotropic behavior of copolymerization reactions in which both reactivity ratios are greater than unity, although some special reactivity ratio combinations ignore the azeotropic behavior. The copolymer composition reaches an azeotrope point at the end of the copolymerization reaction when the copolymerization is an azeotropic reaction. In addition, the randomness parameter takes its maximum value at the azeotrope point when reactivity ratio <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>A</jats:sub></jats:italic> is equal to reactivity ratio <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>B</jats:sub></jats:italic>.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Fluorinated copolymers with perfluoroalkyl side chains have widespread use in applications requiring superior technology due to their unique surface properties. Kinetic analysis of copolymerization of fluorinated acrylates with conventional acrylates is necessary to synthesize such copolymers efficiently. However, kinetic investigation of such reactions are limited in the literature due to the experimental difficulties. In this study, the kinetic of copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with 2-perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate in toluene medium using AIBN initiator was investigated using quantum chemistry postulates as an alternative to experimental methods. Reaction rate constants (kp) for propagation were determined using transition state theory. A terminal effect models were used to examine four different addition reactions involving monomeric and dimeric radicals and monomers for both self- and cross-propagation. Reactant and product conformations were optimized with a DFT method using PBE0 function. The Evans-Polanyi relationship was used to calculate the rate of self- and cross-propagation of monomers. The results showed that the reactivity ratio of 2-perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate was found to be higher than that of methyl methacrylate. In addition, it was observed that the reaction conditions caused the random polymer structure due to the different rate constants in self and cross propagation.</jats:p>",

The copolymers were characterized by IR and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The monomer reactivity ratios were calculated by a non\u2010linear least\u2010square analysis. Thermal analysis indicated a great improvement in thermal stability of the copolymers compared with the methacrylate homopolymers. BrPMI was also polymerized in bulk in the DSC pan, which allowed the calculation of the activation energy of its polymerization. Copyright \u00a9 2003 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

The corresponding reactivity ratios were evaluated by Fineman\u2013Ross, Kelen T\u00fcdos, and error\u2010in\u2010variables model (RREVM) methods. The reactivity ratios obtained (r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 1) show that alternating copolymers were produced. These results are best explained if the copolymerizations proceed through highly polarized radical transition states rather than styrene\u2013maleic anhydride charge\u2010transfer complexes. Polar solvents stabilize highly polarized radical transition states thereby promoting alternating polymerization at higher temperatures than can be observed in nonpolar solvents. Donor solvents might also stabilize the electrophilic maleic anhydride radical more than the nucleophilic styryl radical thereby tending to depress k<jats:sub>21</jats:sub> relative to k<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>. The copolymerizations were also studied in decalin (a nonpolar, nondonor solvent) at 60\u2010145\u00b0C. At lower temperatures alternating copolymers were combined. However, at temperatures &gt; 120\u00b0C, random copolymers were obtained in decalin. Thus, in decalin, styrene\u2013maleic anhydride charge\u2010transfer complexes are present at lower temperatures where they might play a role in alternation. In decalin the solvation of the polar transition states (relative to the macroradicals and monomers) does not favor copolymerization through such dipolar structures. Thus, at low temperatures growing chains could add to charge\u2010transfer complexes. However, at temperatures above 120\u00b0C the concentration of charge\u2010transfer complexes becomes so small that they can no longer be kinetically important contributions to the copolymerization. Thus, random copolymers with high styrene mole ratios are produced in decalin. The equilibrium constants for complex formation between maleic anhydride and both 1,3\u2010dimethoxybenzene and 1,2,4\u2010trimethoxybenzene were de\u2010termined in 1 : 1 (v/v) CCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/CDCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> using a technique based on changes in the NMR chemical shifts of the maleic anhydride protons. \u00a9 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The initial copolymerization rate increased nonlinearly with increasing 2\u2010hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)/styrene ratio. The copolymerization rate was promoted by solvents containing hydroxyl groups. Two different approaches were used for the prediction of copolymerization rates. The relationships proposed for the copolymerization rates calculation involve the effects of the total monomer concentration, mole fraction of HEMA, and of the solvent type.

This was also confirmed by the Igarashi's theory which revealed a high content of CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010MTI heterodyads. The <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> values for <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI monomer were also assessed (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> = 0.007 and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> = 0.99).

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Water-soluble polymers of acrylamide (AAm) and acrylic acid (AAc) have significant potential in enhanced oil recovery, as well as in other specialty applications. To improve the shear strength of the polymer, a third comonomer, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS), can be added to the pre-polymerization mixture. Copolymerization kinetics of AAm/AAc are well studied, but little is known about the other comonomer pairs (AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc). Hence, reactivity ratios for AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc copolymerization must be established first. A key aspect in the estimation of reliable reactivity ratios is design of experiments, which minimizes the number of experiments and provides increased information content (resulting in more precise parameter estimates). However, design of experiments is hardly ever used during copolymerization parameter estimation schemes. In the current work, copolymerization experiments for both AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc are designed using two optimal techniques (Tidwell-Mortimer and the error-in-variables-model (EVM)). From these optimally designed experiments, accurate reactivity ratio estimates are determined for AMPS/AAm (rAMPS = 0.18, rAAm = 0.85) and AMPS/AAc (rAMPS = 0.19, rAAc = 0.86).</jats:p>",

In particular, major problems are emerged in the study of free radical copolymerization kinetics of HEA. In this work, free\u2010radical copolymerization propagation kinetics of HEA and styrene (ST) are investigated through a computational approach based on density functional theory. Monomer reactivity ratios for HEA/ST copolymerization are calculated at 50\u00b0C and 125\u00b0C, obtaining values that exhibit a weak dependence on temperature. In particular, HEA reactivity ratio, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>HEA</jats:sub>, equal to 0.14 and ST reactivity ratio, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>ST</jats:sub>, equal to 0.31 at 50\u00b0C, whereas <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>HEA</jats:sub> = 0.17 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>ST</jats:sub> = 0.29 at 125\u00b0C.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The kinetics of the graft copolymerization of styrene onto methyl acrylate (MA) and methyl methacrylate copolymers (MMA) containing <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl perester groups have been studied. The synthesis of these perester copolymers was carried out in two steps: (<jats:italic>1</jats:italic>) copolymerization of acrylyl chloride with methyl (meth)acrylate, and (<jats:italic>2</jats:italic>) reaction of the acrylyl chloride copolymer with <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl hydroperoxide. Further, these perester copolymers were usually treated with diazomethane in order to methylate any carboxylic group which might be present. The graft copolymers were separated from both hompolymers by progressive precipitation on addition of methanol to the chloroform solution of the copolymers. The stability of these perester copolymers has been considered and found to depend on whether there are acid groups in the copolymer. The first\u2010order rate constants and the activation energy of decomposition in the absence of acid groups have been evaluated. These values depend on the molar composition of the copolymer; an induced decomposition of peresters is favored by a high perester content, which is responsible for a decrease in <jats:italic>E<jats:sub>a</jats:sub></jats:italic> (26.8 instead of 29.6 kcal./mole). In the presence of free carboxylic groups, some of the perester groups decompose very rapidly, the energy of activation of their decomposition being only 15 instead of 25.6 kcal./mole for the slow step. The degree of conversion attained during the rapid step is a function of the stereochemical structure of the copolymer, and the rate of decomposition is much higher than that produced by the addition of external acid. With the MA perester the rate of grafting is proportional to the square root of the perester concentration while it is first order with respect to the monomer concentration. These dependences were found to hold also for the overall rate of polymerization (from the total weight increase) as well as for the grafting rate (from the isolated graft copolymer and its styrene content). The styrene content of the graft copolymer increases with monomer concentration (e.g., 53.8 and 75.3 for monomer concentrations of 2.6 and 6.1 moles/l., respectively). At low monomer concentration, grafting is greatly favored over homopolymerization; it is also enhanced by the viscosity of the solution. With the MMA perester also, the grafting rate obeys the square root law for the perester concentration and the first\u2010order dependence on monomer. However, the rate of grafting is practically independent of the styrene concentration over a large range. The relative importance of grafting over homopolymerization is in this case much less than with MA\u2010TBP, except at high dilution. Different interpretations are suggested in order to explain the very high and sometimes very low values of <jats:italic>R<jats:sub>g</jats:sub>/R<jats:sub>h</jats:sub></jats:italic>, the ratio of the rate of grafting to the rate of hompolymerization.

The copolymer reactivity ratios were determined with the error\u2010in\u2010variables method using residual monomer concentrations, measured by a Nalco HPLC method. This combination of estimation procedure and analytical technique has been found to be superior to any methods used previously for the estimation of reactivity ratios for cationic\u2010acrylamide copolymers.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the reversible addition\u2013fragmentation transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of two monomers, even with the simple terminal model, there are two kinds of macroradical and two kinds of polymeric RAFT agent with different <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> groups. Because the structure of the <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> group could exert a significant influence on the RAFT process, RAFT copolymerization may behave differently from RAFT homopolymerization. The RAFT copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) in miniemulsion was investigated. The performance of the RAFT copolymerization of MMA/St in miniemulsion was found to be dependent on the feed monomer compositions. When St is dominant in the feed monomer composition, RAFT copolymerization is well controlled in the whole range of monomer conversion. However, when MMA is dominant, RAFT copolymerization may be, in some cases, out of control in the late stage of copolymerization, and characterized by a fast increase in the polydispersity index (PDI). The RAFT process was found to have little influence on composition evolution during copolymerization. The synthesis of the well\u2010defined gradient copolymers and poly[St\u2010b\u2010(St\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010MMA)] block copolymer by RAFT miniemulsion copolymerization was also demonstrated. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the presence of air copolymerization proceeds even without any radical initiator at room temperature. In the radical initiated copolymerization of \u03b1-MeSt (M1) and CAL (M2), the values of monomer reactivity ratios r1=0.033 and r2=0 were obtained. Neither the rate of copolymerization nor viscosity number of the copolymer formed were influenced by the presence of air in the reaction system. The result of copolymerization in the ternary system involving methyl acrylate (MA) could not be entirely explained by the copolymerization equation given by Alfrey and Goldfinger for the three component system. It was found that the composition of the copolymer formed changed with the solvent dilution. Formation of 1 : 1 molecular complex between the monomers was evidenced by the application of the continuous variation method to \u03b1-MeSt-CAL system. It was concluded that the molecular complex due to some donor-acceptor type interaction between CAL and \u03b1-MeSt plays an important role in the copolymerization.</jats:p>",

Little is known of the kinetics and mechanism of copolymerization. TBTM and MMA were copolymerized in the presence of a free radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide) at 80.1\u00b0C. Aliquots, taken at preselected intervals from 0 to 1440 min, were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with ultraviolet (UV) and tin\u2010specific graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) detectors. A UV absorbance observed at 254 nm was associated with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight species, decreasing in concentration continuously with time of reaction. Tin\u2010specific GFAA indicated a decrease in low\u2010molecular\u2010weight species (ca. 350 daltons) with concurrent increases in high\u2010molecular\u2010weight species (ca. 40,000 daltons). The fraction of high molecular\u2010weight increased as a linear function of the logarithm of the time of reaction. SEC\u2013UV\u2013GFAA thus provides a tool of major importance for characterizing the time dependence and continuity of the process by which monomers of TBTM are converted to a useful bioactive slow\u2010release coating material.</jats:p>",

The copolymerization reactivity ratio was calculated using the composition data obtained from 1H NMR spectroscopy, applying Kelen-Tudos and Finemann-Ross methods. The reactivity ratio of styrene (r1 = 0.93) and PDPMA (r2 = 0.05) suggested random copolymerization of the two monomers with alternation. The copolymerization conversion increased with increasing PDPMA concentration of the feed, upto 70 wt % PDPMA, but decreased thereafter. The molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography was lower than the theoretical values and the polydispersity increased from 1.32 to 2.19, with increasing PDPMA content in the feed. The influence of styrene content on the glass transition and thermal decomposition behavior of the copolymers was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Morphological characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a phase separated soft core-hard shell type structure.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The mechanism of the copolymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate has been investigated in mixtures of these monomers using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. The peroxide was decomposed both thermally and photochemically. Experiments on the composition of the polymer as a function of the monomer composition have given the reactivity ratios styrene radical-styrene molecule to styrene radical-butyl acrylate molecule as 0\u00b748 and butyl acrylate radical butyl acrylate molecule to butyl acrylate radical to styrene molecule as 0\u00b715. The kinetics of the copolymerization have been determined, and using the theory already elaborated for the treatment of such reactions, it has been shown by rate and molecular weight measurements that the styrene radicals react with the butyl acrylate radicals more quickly than the mean rate of reaction of styrene to styrene and butyl acrylate to butyl acrylate radicals. The coefficient \u00d8 defining this increased activity is not in this case constant and rises with increasing styrene content to a value of as much as 150. The initiation mechanism is also complicated in that there is no linear relation between the rate of initiation and monomer composition; instead, the rate drops rapidly when styrene is added to the butyl acrylate.</jats:p>",

In this study, we applied the error-in-variables model (EVM) to estimate reactivity ratios. The ternary reactivity ratios were found to be r12 = 0.417, r21 = 0.071, r13 = 4.459, r31 = 0.198, r23 = 0.260, and r32 = 55.339 (BA/MDO/VAc 1/2/3), contrasting with their binary counterparts, which are significantly different, indicating the critical need for ternary system analysis to accurately model multicomponent polymerization systems. Through the application of a recast Alfrey\u2013Goldfinger model, this investigation predicts the terpolymer\u2019s instantaneous and cumulative compositions at various conversion levels, based on the ternary reactivity ratios. These predictions not only provide crucial insights into the incorporation of MDO across different initial feed compositions but also offer estimates of the final terpolymer compositions and distributions, underscoring their potential in designing compostable or degradable polymers.</jats:p>",
