The copolymerizations of a variety of monomers, including styrene, acrylates, methacrylates and vinyl acetate, are investigated. In particular, the monomer and radical reactivity ratios for ST/HEMA, ST/GMA, ST/BMA, ST/HEA, MMA/VAc, ST/MMA, and ST/EA are calculated. Good agreement between the computational and experimental results is obtained for comparisons of the determined parameters with the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, some of the computed reactivity ratios are determined in this work for the first time, and they can be used as an initial guess for future experiments.<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/jpeg\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.jpg\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p>",

The synthesis of these copolymers was investigated over a wide composition range at low conversion levels. Copolymer compositions were determined from the C, H and O contents obtained by elemental analysis. The monomer reactivity ratios and the 95% individual confidence intervals and 95% joint confidence intervals were calculated by the Fineman\u2013Ross, Ezrielev\u2013Brokhina\u2010Roskin, Kelen and T\u00fcd\u00f6s, Extended Kelen and T\u00fcd\u00f6s methods and a linear iterative method proposed by Mao and Huglin. The estimation process was performed by applying non\u2010linear techniques based on Marquardt optimization, ordinary least\u2010squares (OLS) and generalized least\u2010squares approaches and the results were compared. Monomer reactivity ratios and monomer partition coefficients were also analysed on the basis of the bootstrap models by applying the non\u2010linear least\u2010squares approach. Good agreement between experimental and calculated copolymer compositions was obtained. The results show that this copolymerization system is strictly describable by the simple bootstrap terminal model (SBTM) and accurate monomer reactivity ratios can be obtained. The monomer sequence distributions were also calculated using the monomer reactivity ratios obtained from SBTM. Copyright \u00a9 2003 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios for these monomers were measured by running a series of reactions at various feed ratios of initial monomers, and the monomer incorporation into copolymer was determined using <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR. Reactivity ratios of the MMA/MTMP system were measured to be <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub></jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.37 and <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub></jats:italic>\u2009=\u20091.14 from extended Kelen\u2010T\u00fcdos method. The results show that monomer MTMP prefers homopolymerization to copolymerization in the system, whereas monomer MMA prefers copolymerization to homopolymerization. Sequence structures of the MMA/MTMP copolymers were characterized using <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR. The results show that the sequence structure for the main chain of the MMA/MTMP copolymers is mainly composed of a syndiotactic configuration, only with a little heterotactic configuration.

Two main equations are used and the parameters can be calculated from the ordinate and the slope of the linearization plots. Both equations yield identical values when applied to synthetic data which conforms to the ideal situation of no error in the input data. As experimental data are always subject to some kind of error, a sensitivity analysis was carried out which took into account a relatively pronounced error in the monomer reactivity ratios. It turned out that the new linearization method may even be indicative of the quality of the input data under favorable conditions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

The increments of the four rate constants of the growing chain of copolymerization (k11,k12,k21, and k22) with the pressure are all of the same order. In such a case, \u0394V*11 is \u0394V*12, and \u0394V*22 is \u0394V*21 (\u0394V*ij is the activation volume in which the i radical reacted with the j monomer).

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) is an important component of many acrylic resins used in coatings formulations, as the functionality ensures that the chains participate in the cross-linking reactions required to form the final product. Hence, the knowledge of their radical copolymerization kinetic coefficients is vital for both process and recipe improvements. The pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) technique is paired with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to provide kinetic coefficients for the copolymerization of HEMA with butyl methacrylate (BMA) in various solvents. The choice of solvent has a significant impact on both copolymer composition and on the composition-averaged propagation rate coefficient (kp,cop). Compared to the bulk system, both n-butanol and dimethylformamide reduce the relative reactivity of HEMA during copolymerization, while xylene as a solvent enhances HEMA reactivity. The magnitude of the solvent effect varies with monomer concentration, as shown by a systematic study of monomer/solvent mixtures containing 50 vol%, 20 vol%, and 10 vol% monomer. The observed behavior is related to the influence of hydrogen bonding on monomer reactivity, with the experimental results fit using the terminal model of radical copolymerization to provide estimates of reactivity ratios and kp,HEMA.</jats:p>",

Copolymerization kinetics of AAm/AAc are well studied, but little is known about the other comonomer pairs (AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc). Hence, reactivity ratios for AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc copolymerization must be established first. A key aspect in the estimation of reliable reactivity ratios is design of experiments, which minimizes the number of experiments and provides increased information content (resulting in more precise parameter estimates). However, design of experiments is hardly ever used during copolymerization parameter estimation schemes. In the current work, copolymerization experiments for both AMPS/AAm and AMPS/AAc are designed using two optimal techniques (Tidwell-Mortimer and the error-in-variables-model (EVM)). From these optimally designed experiments, accurate reactivity ratio estimates are determined for AMPS/AAm (rAMPS = 0.18, rAAm = 0.85) and AMPS/AAc (rAMPS = 0.19, rAAc = 0.86).</jats:p>",

In particular, the study analyses the effect of the number of ethylene glycol (EG) groups along the lateral chains of PEGMA and is carried out under fully ionized conditions of MAA at different initial monomer ratios and initial overall monomer concentrations (5\u201320 wt % in aqueous solution). The composition drift with conversion indicates that PEGMA macromonomer is more reactive than MAA. Individual monomer consumption rates show that the rates of consumption of both monomers are not first order with respect to overall concentration of the monomer. The reactivity ratios estimated from the copolymerization kinetics reveal, that for the short PEGMA, the reactivity ratios rMAA and rPEGMA increase with the solids content (SC). A totally different trend is obtained for the longer PEGMA, whose reactivity ratio (rPEGMA23) decreases with solids content, whereas the reactivity ratio of MAA remains roughly constant.</jats:p>",

In particular, major problems are emerged in the study of free radical copolymerization kinetics of HEA. In this work, free\u2010radical copolymerization propagation kinetics of HEA and styrene (ST) are investigated through a computational approach based on density functional theory. Monomer reactivity ratios for HEA/ST copolymerization are calculated at 50\u00b0C and 125\u00b0C, obtaining values that exhibit a weak dependence on temperature. In particular, HEA reactivity ratio, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>HEA</jats:sub>, equal to 0.14 and ST reactivity ratio, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>ST</jats:sub>, equal to 0.31 at 50\u00b0C, whereas <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>HEA</jats:sub> = 0.17 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>ST</jats:sub> = 0.29 at 125\u00b0C. Moreover, the reliability of such parameters has been tested by analyzing copolymer composition data as a function of monomer feed composition, at the same temperatures indicated above. Experimental values proposed in literature are well predicted by the terminal copolymerization model using the kinetic parameters computationally determined. POLYM. ENG.

The system was mediated by copper bromide/4,4\u2032\u2010dinonyl\u20102,2\u2032\u2010bipyridyl and stabilized by polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The effects of the initiator concentration and temperature profile on the polymerization kinetics and latex stability were systematically examined. Both EHMA homopolymerization and successive copolymerization with MMA proceeded in a living manner and gave good control over the polymer molecular weights. The polymer molecular weights increased linearly with the monomer conversion with polydispersities lower than 1.2. A low\u2010temperature prepolymerization step was found to be helpful in stabilizing the latex systems, whereas further polymerization at an elevated temperature ensured high conversion rates. The EHMA polymers were effective as macroinitiators for initiating the block polymerization of MMA. Triblock poly(methyl methacrylate\u20132\u2010ethylhexyl methacrylate\u2013methyl methacrylate) samples with various block lengths were synthesized.

The obtained copolymers (PMMA4VP) were examined by FTIR and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopies. The composition of these copolymers was calculated, using <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectra and elemental analysis. Monomer reactivity ratios were estimated from Fineman\u2013Ross (FR, <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>m</jats:sub></jats:italic> = 0.550, <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>v</jats:sub></jats:italic> = 1.165) and Kelen\u2013Tudos (KT, <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>m</jats:sub></jats:italic> = 0.559, <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>v</jats:sub></jats:italic> = 1.286) linearization methods, as well as nonlinear error in variables model (EVM) method using the RREVM computer program (RREVM, <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>m</jats:sub></jats:italic> = 0.559, <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>v</jats:sub></jats:italic> = 1.264). These values suggest that MMA\u20104VP pair copolymerizes randomly. <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectra provide information about the stereochemistry of the copolymers in terms of sequence distributions and configurations. These results showed that the age of the Ni complex has an impact not only on its activity towards polymerization reactions but also on the features of the corresponding copolymers, whereas the chemical composition was insensitive to this prominent factor. The mechanism of MMA\u20104VP copolymerization is consistent with a radical process as supported by microstructure and molecular weight distribution studies. Thermal behaviours of these copolymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 2008</jats:p>",

The copolymerization behavior was studied in different composition with the mole fractions of GMA ranging from 0.20 to 0.80 in the feed and under 10% copolymer conversion. The copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The thermogravimetric analysis of the copolymers suggest an overall decrease in the thermal stability of the copolymer with decreasing content of GMA in the copolymers. Thermal decomposition activation energies are calculated by the Ozawa method. The copolymer composition was determined by the application of elemental analysis method. The monomer reactivity ratios were estimated by the application of conventional linearization methods, such as Kelen\u2013Tudos (K\u2010T), Fineman\u2013Ross (F\u2010R) methods, and a nonlinear error in variable model (RREVM) method using a computer program, and all results were discussed and compared with the literature.</jats:p>",

The copolymerization reactivity ratio was calculated using the composition data obtained from 1H NMR spectroscopy, applying Kelen-Tudos and Finemann-Ross methods. The reactivity ratio of styrene (r1 = 0.93) and PDPMA (r2 = 0.05) suggested random copolymerization of the two monomers with alternation. The copolymerization conversion increased with increasing PDPMA concentration of the feed, upto 70 wt % PDPMA, but decreased thereafter. The molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography was lower than the theoretical values and the polydispersity increased from 1.32 to 2.19, with increasing PDPMA content in the feed. The influence of styrene content on the glass transition and thermal decomposition behavior of the copolymers was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Morphological characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a phase separated soft core-hard shell type structure. The complex viscosity and adhesion properties like peel strength and lap shear strength of the copolymer on different substrates increased with increasing styrene content.</jats:p>",

The monomer reactivity ratios of these copolymers were not affected by the pressure, while their molecular weights and overall rates of copolymerization increased with the pressure. The increments of the four rate constants of the growing chain of copolymerization (k11,k12,k21, and k22) with the pressure are all of the same order. In such a case, \u0394V*11 is \u0394V*12, and \u0394V*22 is \u0394V*21 (\u0394V*ij is the activation volume in which the i radical reacted with the j monomer). The conclusion drawn from our previous works, that the monomer reactivity ratios of the copolymerization between nonconjugated monomers are independent of the pressure was supported by the experimental results of this report.</jats:p>",

It can be concluded that copolymerization of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MMA</jats:styled-content> with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DPA</jats:styled-content> is ideal while copolymerization of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ST</jats:styled-content> with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DPA</jats:styled-content> has a small but noticeable tendency for block copolymer building. The probabilities for formations of dyad and triad monomer sequences dependent on monomer compositions were calculated from the obtained reactivity ratios. The molar mass distribution, thermal stability and glass transition temperatures of synthesized copolymers were determined. Hydrophobicity of copolymers depending on the composition was determined using contact angle measurements, decreasing from hydrophobic polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) to hydrophilic <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DPA</jats:styled-content>. Copolymerization reactivity ratios are crucial for the control of copolymer structural properties and conversion heterogeneity that greatly influence the applications of copolymers as rheology modifiers of lubricating oils or in drug delivery systems. \u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

Reactivity ratios of St and MA were calculated by the extended Kelen\u2010Tudos (KT) and Mao\u2010Huglin (MH) methods to be <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>St</jats:sub> = 1.018 \u00b1 0.060, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MA</jats:sub> = 0.177 \u00b1 0.025 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>St</jats:sub> = 1.016 \u00b1 0.053, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MA</jats:sub> = 0.179 \u00b1 0.023, respectively, which are in a good agreement with those reported for the conventional free\u2010radical copolymerization of St and MA. Good agreement between the theoretical and experimental composition drifts in the comonomer mixture and copolymer as a function of the overall monomer conversion were observed, indicating that the reactivity ratios calculated by copolymer composition at the moderate to high conversion are accurate. Instantaneous copolymer composition curve and number\u2010average sequence length of comonomers in the copolymer indicated that the copolymerization system tends to produce a random copolymer. However, MA\u2010centered triad distribution results indicate that the spontaneous gradient copolymers can also be obtained when the mole fraction of MA in the initial comonomer mixture is high enough. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The crosspropagation of 1\u2010ethylcyclopentyl methacrylate (ECPMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) has been studied using a combination of quantum chemistry calculations and experiment. Our computational work utilizes a trimer\u2010to\u2010tetramer reaction model, coupled with an ONIOM (B3LYP/6\u201031G(2df,p): B3LYP/6\u201031G(d)) method for geometry optimization and an M06\u20102X/6\u2010311+G(2df,p) method plus SMD solvation model for single point energy calculations. The results show several trends: the identity of the ultimate unit of a trimer radical affects not only the preferred conformation of the region where the reaction takes place, but also the reactivity of the radical; the addition of an ECPMA monomer to the radicals is generally favored compared to an MMA monomer; the pen\u2010penultimate unit of a trimer radical shows a nonnegligible entropic effect; the penultimate unit effect is implicit for the ECPMA\u2013MMA copolymer system. Finally, terminal model reactivity ratios fitted based on the explicit rate coefficients calculated from the quantum chemical results are compared with those from experimental measurements. The computations not only agree qualitatively with experimentally derived results in terms of the selectivity of ECPMA\u2013MMA crosspropagation, but also give reasonable quantitative predictions of reactivity ratios.\n<jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/png\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mats201500072-abs-0001-m.png\"><jats:alt-text>image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text></jats:p>",

All reactions presented pseudolinear kinetics. The effect of the monomer feed ratio on the copolymerization kinetics was examined. The conversion level decreased when the proportion of ethyl \u03b1\u2010hydroxymethylacrylate in the monomer feed was larger. Kinetic studies indicated that the radical polymerizations proceeded with apparent living character according to experiments, demonstrating an increase in the molar mass with the monomer conversion and a relatively narrow molar mass distribution. All copolymers were statistical in chain structure, as confirmed by determinations of the monomer reactivity ratios. The monomer reactivity ratios were determined, and the Mayo\u2013Lewis terminal model provided excellent predictions for the variations of the intermolecular structure over the entire conversion range. Additionally, the chemical modification of poly(ethyl \u03b1\u2010hydroxymethylacrylate) was carried out to introduce glucose pendant groups into the structure. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Methyl vinyl ketone was firstly used to successfully copolymerize with acrylonitrile. This was achieved by using azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator, and dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent. Effect of copolymerization systems on monomer apparent reactivity ratios for copolymer of acrylonitrile with methyl vinyl ketone was studied for contrast. Values of monomer apparent reactivity ratios were calculated by Kelen\u2013Tudos method. It has been found that the apparent reactivity ratios in aqueous suspension polymerization system were similar to those in solution polymerization system at polymerization conversion less than 20%. Beyond 50% of conversion, the changes of monomer apparent reactivity ratios become less prominent. In water\u2010rich reaction medium [(H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)&gt;80/20), monomer apparent reactivity ratios were approximately equivalent to those in aqueous suspension polymerization system. In DMSO\u2010rich reaction medium (DMSO/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O &gt; 80/20), apparent reactivity ratios were similar to those in solution polymerization system. Values of apparent reaction ratios both decreased when AN/MVK copolymer was synthesized in DMF and DMAc.

PVAc and PBuA homopolymer latexes as well as the (VAc\u2010BuA) copolymer latexes were characterized with respect to particle size, molecular weight, acid end groups on particle surfaces, and colloidal stability against electrolytes. The surface and colloidal properties of these latexes were also compared before and after aging and acid hydrolysis. The average particle size of batch latexes was independent of copolymer composition, whereas for semicontinuous latexes it decreased with increasing BuA content and was always lower than that of the corresponding batch latex. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) for batch latexes was narrower and much less dependent on composition than that of the semicontinuous latexes; bimodal MWD was found in most semicontinuous latexes with a substantial amount of low MW fraction. The total weak and strong acid end groups on particle surfaces for semicontinuous latexes is higher, and more dependent on composition, than the batch latexes. Acid\u2010induced hydrolysis results in a drastic change in the type and concentration of the surface groups of the semicontinuous latex particles. Colloidal stability against electrolytes showed that both electrostatic (due to surface acid groups) and steric [due to surface poly(vinyl alcohol)] mechanisms are contributing. However, for semicontinuous latexes, increasing PVAc content above 50 mol % resulted in a proportional increase and ultimately dominant role of steric stabilization. The results were interpreted in terms of differences in reactivity ratios and water solubilities of the two monomers and their effects on the locus of initiation and growth in the two polymerization processes, as well as the monomer sequence within the polymer chain and degree of homogeniety of the copolymer composition within the particle.</jats:p>",

The synthesis of these copolymers was investigated over a wide composition range both at low and high conversion levels. Copolymer compositions were determined from the %C, %H, and %O contents of copolymer by elemental analysis. Monomer reactivity ratios were estimated by analyzing composition data with nonlinear least\u2010squares (NLLS) models based on Marquardt optimization and van Herk methods. The point estimates, 95% individual confidence intervals and 95% joint confidence intervals are obtained from differential and integral approaches. Even though no explicit integral form for penultimate unit model (PUM) is available, a numerical approach is developed for integral estimation of reactivity ratios from PUM. A simulator program was developed which upon coupling of experimental data, NLLS analysis, and D\u2010optimal criteria calculates the best optimized values of monomer reactivity ratios and monomer feed compositions in a sequential and iterative order for terminal and penultimate unit models. Moreover, the simulator has the capibilities to calculate all features of van Herk method, maximum compositional drift in each monomer feed composition, and data reconciliation. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

When the monomer and radical approach each other, the acrylate anion becomes the least reactive species because of its symmetrical charge distribution, like charge repulsion and barium ion screening effect. HMO calculations were performed for models of all monomers and polymer radicals involved in copolymerizations. The experimental results concerning the reactivity of acrylic acid and acrylamide in copolymerization and the observed reactivity ratios were discussed on the basis of HMO calculations and resonance and Coulomb electrostatic effects. The observed reactivity ratios were correlated with the calculated differences in resonance energies computed for the models of transition states involved in copolymerizations.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios of charged monomers depend on the pH of the medium, acrylic acid is the more reactive monomer below pH 3 and acrylamide above pH 4. The working pH was set at 3.6, a candidate for the crossover point, where no composition drift is expected. Copolymerization kinetics is investigated at this pH at various ionic strengths and a reaction without composition drift up to 80% conversion was achieved. All the chains produced in this reaction contain 30% \u00b1 3% acrylic acid. Copolymer conversions, molecular weights, and composition distributions were measured through Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization (ACOMP) system. The copolymerization data were analyzed by a recent error in variables method (EVM) and reactivity ratios are calculated. The results show that in salt free conditions, the reactivity ratios depend on the ionic monomer concentration (ionic strength) in addition to the pH of the reaction medium. The effect of polyelectrolytic interactions on the reactivity ratios and the resulting composition drift during the reaction, sequence length distribution, and Stockmayer bivariate distribution are discussed in detail. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The estimation process was performed by applying nonlinear techniques based on Marquardt optimization, \u201cordinary least square\u201d (OLS) and \u201cgeneralized least square\u201d (GLS) approaches and the results were compared with each other. The novel GLS estimator program developed during this study was employed to ascertain the shape of the copolymer composition curve and good agreement between experimental and calculated copolymer composition was obtained. Also, both real and simulated data was presented, which show GLS method is a statistically valid technique for estimating reactivity ratios by accounting response error structure. This new estimation method handles regression models with error terms that are heteroskedastic or serially correlated, or both.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>95% joint confidence interval for reactivity ratios from \u201cNLLS\u201d analysis.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>95% joint confidence interval for reactivity ratios from \u201cNLLS\u201d analysis.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

The copolymerizations were simulated on the basis of the monomer reactivity ratios to calculate the feed and copolymer composition changes, sequence distributions, and so forth as a function of the initial feed ratio and conversion.

This deviation also appears to be influenced by the reaction temperature. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part A: Polym Chem 43: 3868\u20133877, 2005</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The influence of alcohol and alcohol/water solutions on the radical copolymerization kinetics of 2\u2010hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with 2\u2010methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA) is studied using pulsed\u2010laser\u2010polymerization coupled with size exclusion chromatography. It is found that MEA incorporation into the copolymer is increased in butanol, methanol (MeOH), and MeOH/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O solutions relative to the bulk system. Copolymer composition can be represented for solvent levels \u226550\u2009vol.% by a single pair of reactivity ratios (\u00a0=\u00a02.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16, =\u20090.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02) that differ from those in bulk (\u00a0=\u00a03.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44, =\u20090.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04). MeOH as solvent slightly reduces the propagation rate coefficient  of HEMA compared to the bulk system, in contrast to the increase in the MEA  value. Thus, the value of  is higher in MeOH for MEA\u2010rich systems compared to bulk, with the effect of the solvent reduced as the HEMA content in the comonomer mixture is increased. Adding water as cosolvent significantly increases  values for both monomers, with  in MeOH/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O higher than bulk values over the complete composition range. Furthermore,  for 50% monomer in the solvent systems studied can be represented by the implicit penultimate unit model using a single pair of radical reactivity ratios. It is concluded that the strongest influence of hydrogen\u2010bonding solvents compared to bulk is on the homopropagation  values, rather than on copolymerization parameters, and that the difference in relative reactivity of non\u2010functional and functional monomers in bulk and aqueous solution should be accounted for when studying emulsion copolymerization.</jats:p>",

The free\u2010radical\u2010initiated copolymerization of pMPOEMA and pClPOEMA with PAMA was carried out in 1,4\u2010dioxane solution at 65\u00b0C using 2,2\u2032\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator with different monomer\u2010to\u2010monomer ratios in the feed. The monomers and copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR spectral studies. The copolymer compositions were evaluated from nitrogen content in polymers. The reactivity ratios of the monomers were determined by applying Fineman\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f6s methods. The analysis of reactivity ratios revealed that pMPOEMA and pClPOEMA are less reactive than PAMA is, and copolymers formed are statistically in nature.

Thermogravimetric analysis of the polymers reveals that the thermal stability of the copolymers increases with an increase in the mole fraction of pMPOEMA and pClPOEMA in the copolymers. Glass transition temperatures of the copolymers were found to decrease with an increase in the mole fraction of PAMA in the copolymers. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several of these radical copolymerizations were not successful in contrast to that of CTFE with <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI, although <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI monomer does not homopolymerize under radical initiation. The resulting poly(CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI) copolymers were characterized by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H and <jats:sup>19</jats:sup>F nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and their compositions assessed by elemental analysis. The reactivity ratios of both comonomers were determined by linearization methods of Fineman\u2010Ross, Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u00f6s for low conversions of monomers, and by the extended Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u00f6s method for high monomer conversions. The average values of the monomer reactivity ratios, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>CTFE</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub>, were 0.076 and 0.034 at 130 \u00b0C, respectively, depending on these monomer conversions and the applied methods of calculation. In all cases, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>CTFE</jats:sub> \u00d7 <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> product was close to zero, which indicates that poly(CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI) copolymers exhibit a high tendency toward alternation. This was also confirmed by the Igarashi's theory which revealed a high content of CTFE\u2010<jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010MTI heterodyads. The <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> values for <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI monomer were also assessed (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> = 0.007 and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010TMI</jats:sub> = 0.99). As well as this kinetics of copolymerization, several properties of the obtained fluorofunctional copolymers such as molecular weights (ranging from 1500 to 8200 g mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>), molecular weight distributions (from 1.2 to 2.1) were also investigated.

The values of \u03b4 (= <jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>t</jats:italic></jats:sub><jats:sup>1/2</jats:sup>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub>) for MMA and GMA were determined to be 10.25 and 3.00 (mole\u2010sec/l.)<jats:sup>1/2</jats:sup>, respectively. Using the values <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (MMA), <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (GMA), \u03b4<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (MMA), \u03b4<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (GMA), and <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub>, the cross\u2010termination constants \u03d5 for MMA\u2013GMA monomers were determined (average value \u03d5 = 0.42). The increase in <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub> values with increasing GMA content has been attributed to the cross\u2010termination of MMA\u2013GMA radicals. The transfer constant of TP has also been determined for GMA and found to be 1.00. A MMA\u2013GMA copolymer of low molecular weight, containing 2.01% of oxirane oxygen, was modified by opening of the oxirane ring of GMA by reaction with diethanolamine (DEA). The reaction was carried out at 70 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, the copolymer content of epoxy groups and the amine being assumed to be in the molar ratio of 1:4. Addition of a hydrogen\u2010bond acceptor like nitrobenzene decreases, while addition of a hydrogen\u2010bond donor like phenol increases the rate of epoxy ring opening with DEA. This indicates that a hydrogen\u2010bonded intermediate is involved in this reaction and that it weakens the epoxy ring and enhances the rate of its opening with DEA. From the studies of the conversion rates, existence of a \u201cnonspecific\u201d side reaction has been shown which involves the reaction of the terminal epoxy groups of the copolymer and the hydroxyl groups of DEA or formed in the reaction with DEA (involves a chain coupling). DEA can be trifunctional in this reaction. This has been further confirmed from the increase of number\u2010average molecular weights M\u0304<jats:sub><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sub> of the copolymers resulting from this coupling and the nitrogen content in the copolymers after modification with DEA.</jats:p>",

The synthesized copolymers were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and their thermal properties were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The copolymers compositions were determined by elemental analysis. The monomer reactivity ratios have been calculated by linearization methods proposed by Kelen-Tudos and Fineman-Ross. The derived reactivity ratios (r1, r2) for (AM-co-MMA) are: (0.03, 0.593). The microstructure of copolymers and sequence distribution of monomers in the copolymers were calculated by statistical method based on the average reactivity ratios and found that these values are in agreement with the derived reactivity ratios. Copolymers of AM with MMA formed alternating copolymers.\n\nKeywords: Acrylamide; Methyl methacrylate; Reactivity ratios; Sequence distribution</jats:p>",

Vinylene carbonate was found to copolymerize with TBTFMA. Although none of the monomers underwent radical homopolymerization under normal conditions, they copolymerized readily, producing a copolymer containing 60\u201370 mol % TFMA. The copolymerization of the TFMA monomer with norbornenes and vinyl ethers deviated from the terminal model and could be described by the penultimate model.

The large differences found in the reactivity ratios may be attributed to the different ratio of concentration of two monomers in the loci of polymerization. Chemically, AN is somewhat more reactive than MEA as shown by the reactivity ratios in DMSO. In the case of the suspension polymerization, the MEA/AN ratio in the polymer particles in which polymerization occurs may be higher than that in the total phase. Experimental results of the emulsion polymerization show that the emulsion polymerization of AN occurs both in the particles and in water. In addition, rates of the copolymerization of AN with MEA have also been investigated.</jats:p>",

The monomer reactivity ratios of these systems at 60\u00b0C were determined by the conventional schemes using the methods of Fineman\u2013Ross, Joshi\u2010Joshi, and Kelen\u2013T\u00fcdos. DMP underwent a completely random and azeotropic copolymerization with MMA whereas in its reaction with the other acrylates DMP entered preferentially into the polymer chain. The reactivities of DMP\u2010terminated polymer radicals towards the acrylate monomers were found to be in the order: MMA &gt; EA &gt; MA &gt; BA. An increase in solvent polarity decreased the relative reactivity of DMP for the DMP\u2010MMA pair. An examination of the molecular weights of the copolymers revealed the occurrence of chain transfer caused by DMP. The copolymer glass transition temperatures were determined and the variations of <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>g</jats:italic></jats:sub> with copolymer compositions were discussed according to the theory of Johnston, taking into account the effect of the sequence distributions of the comonomers on <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>g</jats:italic></jats:sub>.

This was achieved with azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator. The kinetics of the copolymerization of AN with MVK were investigated in a H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixture between 50 and 70\u00b0C under N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> atmosphere. The rate of copolymerization was measured. The kinetic equation of the copolymerization system was obtained, and the overall activation energy for the copolymerization system was determined. The values of the monomer apparent reactivity ratios were calculated by the Kelen\u2013Tudos method. In a DMSO\u2010rich reaction medium (DMSO/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O &gt; 80/20), the monomer apparent reactivity ratios were similar to those in the solution polymerization system. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Free radical copolymerization of two monomers is usually described in terms of reactivity ratios, only two of which are needed for the simplest (Mayo\u2010Lewis) model. Other, more complex models (such as penultimate unit effects or complex formation) require more kinetic parameters for a complete description. Published summaries of reactivity ratios list values for about 700 monomers taken from more than 1400 publications. These values represent an enormous amount of descriptive and physico\u2010chemical information about copolymerization in particular and free radical reactivity in general. It is important that we understand the limits to the numerical correctness of existing data, and that future data gathering be done in a statistically correct manner. In this paper several different linear and non\u2010linear regression approaches to estimating reactivity ratios are reviewed with emphasis being placed on the Mayo\u2010Lewis model. Two separate problems are recognized: the first is that of model discrimination, the second that of parameter estimation. It is rare that both problems can be properly treated with a single set of experiments, and we discuss the experimental approaches needed to obtain statistically good results.</jats:p>",

Reactivity ratios were calculated according to the general copolymerization equation using Fineman\u2010Ross, Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u0151s and the YBR methods. The results indicate that reactivity of the methacrylates towards growing HEMA radicals decreased in the order, methyl methacrylate &gt; 2\u2010dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate &gt; 2,3\u2010epoxypropyl methacrylate. Reactivity of the acrylates decreased in the order butyl acrylate &gt; ethyl acrylate &gt; methyl acrylate. In the HEMA\u2010acrylate systems, the intrinsic viscosity of the copolymers decreased with increasing content of the acrylates in the copolymer. On the other hand, the intrinsic viscosity of the copolymers of HEMA\u2010MMA showed an increasing trend with increasing content of MMA in the copolymer. Changing the polymerization medium from DMF to water resulted in copolymers having a higher HEMA content.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The complete error-in-variables-model (EVM) framework, consisting of both design of experiments and parameter estimation stages, is applied to the terpolymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS, M1), acrylamide (AAm, M2) and acrylic acid (AAc, M3). This water-soluble terpolymer has potential for applications in enhanced oil recovery, but the associated terpolymerization kinetic characteristics are largely unstudied. In the current paper, EVM is used to design optimal experiments (for the first time in the literature), and reactivity ratios are subsequently estimated based on both low and medium-high conversion data. The results from the medium-high conversion data are more precise than those from the low conversion data, and are therefore used next to predict the terpolymer composition trajectory over the full course of conversion. Good agreement is seen between experimental data and model predictions, which confirms the accuracy of the newly determined ternary reactivity ratios: r12 = 0.66, r21 = 0.82, r13 = 0.82, r31 = 0.61, r23 = 1.61, r32 = 0.25.</jats:p>",

The kinetic analysis of this copolymerization system indicates an apparent propagation rate coefficient independent of the monomer feed composition as well as a limiting conversion that decreases as the styrene monomer feed decreases.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It was reported earlier that the copolymerization of acrylamide and styrene is strongly affected by the copolymerization medium. The effect was attributed to a change in the polarity of the ethylenic bond in the acrylamide monomer due to hydrogen bonding and/or dipole\u2014dipole interaction, depending on the medium. In view of those findings, it was suggested that absolute values for the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of these two monomers might be obtained only when the acrylamide monomer is unperturbed. Copolymerizations of these monomers at a number of ratios, therefore, were done in benzene, which does not undergo hydrogen bonding and has no dipole moment, at high dilution, when amide\u2014amide interactions between acrylamide molecules should be essentially eliminated. The values of <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = acrylamide) were 9.14 \u00b1 0.27 and 0.67 \u00b1 0.08, respectively. There appears to be some indication in this system that high dilution adversely affects the reactivity of the acrylamide monomer while enhancing that of styrene. This aspect requires more study.</jats:p>",

A combination of the low and high conversion data with data from a previous study yielded reactivity ratio (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>) estimates of 27.465 and 0.0102 for <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MMA</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>VAc</jats:sub>, respectively, using the integrated copolymer composition (Meyer\u2013Lowry) equation. In the high conversion experiments the effects of various factors on the reaction rate, cumulative copolymer composition, number\u2010 and weight\u2010average molecular weights, and molecular weight distribution were studied. The factors included the monomer feed composition, initiator concentration, temperature, solvent concentration, and the addition of <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\u2010dodecyl mercaptan chain transfer agent. These factors were examined in light of the wide difference in the monomer reactivity ratios. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 82: 1238\u20131255, 2001</jats:p>",

A mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate and poly(ethylene oxide) (23) dodecyl ether (Brij\u201035; 3 : 1 w/w) was used as a stabilizer. Potassium persulfate was used as an initiator. The true values of the monomer reactivity ratios were 0.028 \u00b1 3.2 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> for vinyl acetate and 6.219 \u00b1 3.1 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> for butyl acrylate, and these were in agreement with those reported in the literature for bulk copolymerizations but differed from values reported for other compartmentalized copolymerizations.

The 60\u00b0C rate constants for propagation and termination in styrene homopolymerization were taken to be 176 and 2.7 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>7</jats:sup> mole/l.\u2010sec, respectively. The corresponding figures for \u03b1\u2010methylstyrene are 26 and 8.1 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> mole/l.\u2010sec. These constants account for the sluggish copolymerization behavior of the latter monomer and the low molecular weights of its copolymers. The simple reaction scheme proposed here suggests that high molecular weight styrene\u2013\u03b1\u2010methylstyrene copolymers can be produced at reasonable rates at 60\u00b0C by emulsion polymerization. This is shown to be the case.</jats:p>",

Seven 35% solids (83 : 17 mol %) VDC\u2013BMA copolymer latexes were prepared: one batch (G), one seeded batch (F), and 5 seeded semicontinuous polymerizations of 5 different monomer feed rates ranging from 0.27 (A) to 1.10 wt %/min (E). The kinetic studies of seeded semicontinuous polymerizations A\u2010E showed that the rates of polymerizations (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub>) were controlled by the monomer addition rates (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>a</jats:italic></jats:sub>). The conversion versus time curves for the polymerizations of 0 : 100\u2013100 : 0 VDC\u2013BMA mixtures by batch polymerization showed that the rate of polymerization (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>p</jats:italic></jats:sub>) was a function of the number of particles, and that the rate of polymerization in a latex particle (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>pp</jats:sub>) increased with increasing proportions of butyl methacrylate in the monomer mixture. All of the latexes had narrow particle size distributions. The greater particle number density in VDC polymerization and the greater water solubility of VDC suggest that the homogeneous nucleation mechanism is operative in VDC\u2013BMA copolymerizations. The latex copolymers prepared by semicontinuous polymerization had lower number\u2010and weight\u2010average molecular weights than those of the corresponding batch copolymers, resulting from the monomer starvation occurring during the semicontinuous polymerization. The surface characterization study of the cleaned latexes showed that for the latexes by batch process, the surface charge density derived from strong\u2010acid groups decreased with increasing proportion of VDC in the monomer mixture. On the other hand, for the latexes prepared by semicontinuous polymerization, the surface charge density derived from strong\u2010acid groups did not depend on the monomer composition of the copolymers.</jats:p>",

According to COPOINT the reactivity ratios were found to be equal to 0.292 for NVP and 2.673 for IBMA for conventional radical polymerization, whereas for RAFT polymerization and for the penultimate model the following reactivity ratios were obtained: r11 = 4.466, r22 = 0, r21 = 14.830, and r12 = 0 (1 stands for NVP and 2 for IBMA). In all cases, the NVP reactivity ratio was significantly lower than that of IBMA. Structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions and the mean sequence length. The thermal properties of the copolymers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential thermogravimetry (DTG). The results were compared with those of the respective homopolymers.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, until now all procedures have shown shortcomings because the real\u2010error structure of the observations has not been taken into account. A new algorithm that does account correctly for measurement errors in both variables is described. A computational method is illustrated for copolymerization data obtained from quantitative gas chromatographic analysis of the monomer feed throughout the reaction. It is shown that the actual error structure of the variables corresponds to the assumed error structure. Reliability of the estimates is substantially increased, compared with the existing methods. Standard deviations of the monomer reactivity ratios are given and appear to be in good agreement with reality.</jats:p>",

In this work, from the whole polymer obtained with the CpTiCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/MAO catalyst system, the SPS\u2010<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>\u2010PE copolymer was separated with the temperature rising elution fractionation method, and the structure was specified by <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR. The polymer obtained from the trivalent titanium catalyst, which was thought to be the active species of syndiotactic polystyrene, included both a styrene\u2013styrene sequence and a styrene\u2013ethylene\u2013ethylene\u2013styrene sequence. However, neither the styrene\u2013ethylene\u2013styrene sequence nor the long chain of polyethylene was included. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The compositions of six copolymers were in the range of allyl chloride units, 0.63\u20136.32 mol%. The monomer reactivity ratios r1 and r2 were calculated to be 6.04 and 0.035, respectively. Only three copolymers were soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide and their intrinsic viscosities were found to be greater than 4.5 dL g\u22121. The chlorine contents, although 0.42, 0.87, and 1.03 wt%, were sufficiently effective to cause a change in the behavior of the thermal degradation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN). In DTA curves measured at a rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121 under nitrogen for copolymers containing ca. 1 wt% of chlorine, a sharp exotherm due to the polymerization of cyano groups shifted to the higher-temperature side (ca. 40 \u00b0C) and the differential temperature decreased to about 1/6. Moreover, the weight loss at 350 \u00b0C decreased from 19 wt% for PAN to 13 wt%. A similar thermal-degradation behavior was also observed for acrylonitrile\u2013\u03b1-chloroacrylonitrile (CAN) copolymers. However, there was a great difference between allyl chloride and CAN units concerning the effect on the thermal degradation of PAN. Namely, only 1.5 mol% of allyl chloride units corresponded to 10 mol% of CAN units.</jats:p>",

The rates of dispersion polymerization are proportional to the particle concentration. The number of particles increses up to 50% conversion. The particle growth is suggested to proceed via association of partcles and by propagation within polymer particles. The decrese of the number of radicals per particles as conversion proceeds is ascribed to the decrese of the growing radical activity and to the transfer of monomeric radicals to the continuous phase. The molecular weights correlate inversely with the particle size.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Fluorinated copolymers with perfluoroalkyl side chains have widespread use in applications requiring superior technology due to their unique surface properties. Kinetic analysis of copolymerization of fluorinated acrylates with conventional acrylates is necessary to synthesize such copolymers efficiently. However, kinetic investigation of such reactions are limited in the literature due to the experimental difficulties. In this study, the kinetic of copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with 2-perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate in toluene medium using AIBN initiator was investigated using quantum chemistry postulates as an alternative to experimental methods. Reaction rate constants (kp) for propagation were determined using transition state theory. A terminal effect models were used to examine four different addition reactions involving monomeric and dimeric radicals and monomers for both self- and cross-propagation. Reactant and product conformations were optimized with a DFT method using PBE0 function. The Evans-Polanyi relationship was used to calculate the rate of self- and cross-propagation of monomers. The results showed that the reactivity ratio of 2-perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate was found to be higher than that of methyl methacrylate. In addition, it was observed that the reaction conditions caused the random polymer structure due to the different rate constants in self and cross propagation.</jats:p>",

It was found that the relative reactivities toward the polystyryl radical were not correlated with the ordinary Hammett equation, but a linear relationship was obtained with a modified Hammett equation which contained a term of the resonance contribution by the substituents. Accordingly, it was considered that the reactivities of substituted phenyl methacrylates depend on both polar and resonance effects caused by the substituents.</jats:p>",

Real time FTIR measurements were performed to monitor the depletion of each comonomer double bond during the isothermal curing reaction at 80\u00b0C. From the experimental data corresponding to different feed compositions, the initial reactivity ratios and their evolution with conversion were determined via a nonlinear least squares optimization of the integrated form of the copolymerization equation. The reactivity ratio of St increases continuously and exponentially with the overall reaction conversion, while that of BDMA decreases linearly. A modified terminal copolymerization model including the dependence of the reactivity ratios with the overall conversion was proposed. The application of this model provides a consistent fitting for the conversion of each comonomer during all reaction stages, even at high conversion values where large diffusion and topological restrictions for chain movements are present. Simulations show that the concentration of styrene units added to the copolymer increases with the overall reaction conversion, while that for the BDMA double bonds diminishes. Structures rich in homopolymerized styrene are predicted at later stages of the reaction.\u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010</jats:p>",

The composition of copolymers was determined by UV spectroscopy taking advantage of the very high absorption coefficient (UV) of the monomeric units of 2\u2010VN in copolymer. The monomer reactivity ratios <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> evaluated are as follows.

In DMSO\u2010rich reaction medium (DMSO/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O &gt; 80/20), apparent reactivity ratios are similar to those in solution polymerization system. With an increase in polarity of solvent, values of apparent reaction ratios both decrease.

In this study, we applied the error-in-variables model (EVM) to estimate reactivity ratios. The ternary reactivity ratios were found to be r12 = 0.417, r21 = 0.071, r13 = 4.459, r31 = 0.198, r23 = 0.260, and r32 = 55.339 (BA/MDO/VAc 1/2/3), contrasting with their binary counterparts, which are significantly different, indicating the critical need for ternary system analysis to accurately model multicomponent polymerization systems. Through the application of a recast Alfrey\u2013Goldfinger model, this investigation predicts the terpolymer\u2019s instantaneous and cumulative compositions at various conversion levels, based on the ternary reactivity ratios. These predictions not only provide crucial insights into the incorporation of MDO across different initial feed compositions but also offer estimates of the final terpolymer compositions and distributions, underscoring their potential in designing compostable or degradable polymers.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Densely branched poly(methyl methacrylate)s have been synthesized by copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) using atom transfer free radical polymerization (ATRP). By employing the phenyl and benzyl esters of 2\u2010bromo\u20102\u2010methylpropionic acid as the initiators with 2,2\u2010bipyridyl and Cu(I)Cl it has been possible to use high field <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate in some detail the composition and structure of the branched PMMAs obtained. Parallel molar mass size exclusion chromatographic analysis using a multi\u2010angle light scattering detector with a refractive index detector (MALS/SEC) has allowed the branched architecture of the products to be confirmed. Rather remarkably, high yields of branched PMMAs can be obtained without crosslinking using MMA/EGDMA molar feed ratios of up to 5/1 by appropriate adjustment of the molar feed of initiator. In particular by maintaining the EGDMA/initiator molar feed ratio \u223c1/1 fully soluble products can be obtained that are densely branched since this feed ratio ensures that on average each living primary chain initiated contains on average only one branching EGDMA segment. As might be expected this controlled free radical process offers better control in the synthesis of branched polymer than the corresponding system we have reported using conventional free radical polymerization, and unlike the latter which requires the use of a chain transfer agent, the ATRP system requires no additional chain regulating component. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The copolymers were characterized by conversion, solubility in hot dimethyl sulfoxide, elementary analysis, and infrared spectroscopy. A copolymer composition equation was derived for a special divinyl\u2013vinyl system in which the divinyl monomer would cyclize extensively during polymerization and give rise to soluble, although perhaps branched, copolymers. The results showed that both soluble and insoluble copolymers were obtained, depending on the comonomer used and experimental conditions under which the copolymerization was carried out. In general, soluble copolymers were formed under the following conditions: (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) the less reactive the comonomer in free radical copolymerizations; (<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) the greater the dilution; (<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>) the greater the difference in the moles of the two components in charge; and (<jats:italic>d</jats:italic>) the lower the conversion.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The goal is to present an alternative technique for reactivity ratio estimation in copolymerization. Typically, reactivity ratios are estimated using the instantaneous copolymer composition equation, based on low conversion copolymer composition data. However, using experimental data from the full copolymerization trajectory would, in principle, be more advantageous, and shy away from commonly used restrictive assumptions. Estimation using cumulative copolymerization data and models eliminates the difficulties associated with stopping reactions at low conversion, while one gains to study the full polymerization trajectory. The error\u2010in\u2010variables\u2010model (EVM) method is used for parameter estimation. Two cumulative model forms, the analytical integration of the differential composition equation and the one resulting from the direct numerical integration of this equation, are employed. Using these two types of models improves the reactivity ratio estimation and, in particular, the latter model form is a more reliable and direct method of estimating reactivity ratios. <jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/jpeg\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.jpg\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

The system follows nonideal kinetics (R<jats:sub>p</jats:sub>\u2009\u03b1 [BP]<jats:sup>0.67</jats:sup>[BA]<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>[MMA]<jats:sup>0.98</jats:sup>), and degradative solvent transfer reasonably explains these kinetic nonidealities. The monomer reactivity ratios (MRRs) of MMA and BA have been estimated by the Finemann\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013Tudos methods, by analyzing copolymer compositions determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectra. The values of <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (MMA) and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (BA) were found to be 2.17 and 0.44, respectively, which suggested the high concentration of alternating sequences in the random copolymers obtained. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The reaction order with respect to the initiator concentration was near to the theoretical one (0,5), while that with respect to the total monomer concentration was considerably higher than predicted by theory (1,0). It could be explained by the influence of transfer reactions and diffusion control of termination reactions. Transfer reactions contribute to the reaction order mainly at low monomer concentration, while the influence of the medium viscosity becomes predominant at high monomer concentration.</jats:p>",

Addition of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased the reactivity of the catalyst. The highest product was obtained when 150 mL H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/L solvent was used. Increasing temperature from 40 to 70\u00b0C decreased the productivity of the catalyst, while irregular behavior was observed on ethylene content.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article explores the synthesis of a novel methacrylic macromonomer with an amphiphilic character derived from poly(ethylene glycol) <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010octylphenyl ether (MT) and its respective homopolymer. To know their reactivity in radical copolymerization reactions with methyl methacrylate (MMA), a model monomer (MTm) was synthesized to determine the reactivity ratios and compare them with the low molar fractions of copolymers of MT with MMA because they were difficult to isolate. They were <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MTm</jats:sub> = 0.97 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MMA</jats:sub> = 0.95. The compositional diagrams when representing the weight fraction of MT and MTm in the feed and the copolymer suggested that a clear correlation exists between the experimental points of the model monomer MTm and the macromonomer MT ones, suggesting that the length of the side poly(ethylene oxide) chain does not affect the reactivity of the methacrylic double bond in the prepared monomers for this type of polymerization reaction. The reactivity ratios of the copolymers have a tendency for the formation of random or Bernoullian copolymers. The glass\u2010transition temperatures (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub>'s) of the prepared copolymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry, deviated from the Fox equation, and discussed on the basis of treatments that consider the influence of the monomeric units along the copolymer chains, determining the <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub> of the corresponding alternating dyads. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In ACOMP systems, monomer and polymer concentrations are measured by the monitoring of two independent properties of the system. The reactivity ratios are found by taking into account errors in the monomer concentrations determined from measurements and from calibration of the instruments. All the error sources are taken into account according to the error\u2010in\u2010variables method, and their effects are reflected in determining the confidence intervals of the reactivity ratios by the usual error propagation technique.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Distribution of concentrations [a] and [b] for the simulated experiment I.

The polymer\u2013comonomer mixture systems were so chosen as to permit study of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. The homogeneous systems included systems of low and high viscosity. The heterogeneous systems included both polymers swollen by the comonomer mixture and polymers not swollen by the comonomer mixture. None of the homogeneous grafting systems studied showed deviations from the normal copolymerization behavior under a variety of experimental conditions. Monomer reactivity ratios in graft copolymerization were the same as the values in nongraft copolymerization. The heterogeneous systems in which the polymer was swollen by the comonomer mixture yielded grafted copolymer compositions which were the same as those in nongraft copolymerization. The heterogeneous grafting system polytetrafluoroethylene/styrene\u2013acrylonitrile showed deviations from normal copolymerization behavior at low degrees of grafting when the reaction was only on the polymer surface. The behavior became normal at higher degrees of grafting when the system approaches that in which the polymer is swollen by the comonomers. In all reaction systems, it was found that the use of radiation to initiate the reaction does not in any way affect the copolymerization behavior of the two monomers in a comonomer pair.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p> The copolymer P(AM-DMC), one kind of cationic polyacrylamide, was synthesized by using acrylamide (AM) and methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC) as monomers with ultraviolet initiation. The copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The composition of the copolymer was determined from the chlorine content by silver nitrate titration. The effects of monomer feed ratio and conversion on the composition of copolymer were discussed. Reactivity ratios were determined by the Fineman-Ross, Kelen-Tudos and Yezrielev-Brokhina-Roskin methods, indicating that their positive order calculation results were very different with those of reverse order, when the reactivity ratios were determined by Fineman-Ross. However, their positive order and reverse order calculation results were similar when the reactivity ratios were determined by the Kelen-Tudos and Yezrielev-Brokhina-Roskin methods. Therefore, the reactivity ratios were determined using the average results of the Kelen-Tudos and Yezrielev-Brokhina-Roskin methods. The reactivity ratios of AM and DMC were 2.3398 and 0.2285, respectively. This result showed that the copolymerization of AM and DMC was a non-ideal random copolymerization. Furthermore, the content of AM segments decreased with the increase of AM feed content, but the content of DMC segments increased. Moreover, the sequence length distribution was irregular and narrow, because AM was prone to homopolymerization. </jats:p>",

Because the structure of the <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> group could exert a significant influence on the RAFT process, RAFT copolymerization may behave differently from RAFT homopolymerization. The RAFT copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) in miniemulsion was investigated. The performance of the RAFT copolymerization of MMA/St in miniemulsion was found to be dependent on the feed monomer compositions. When St is dominant in the feed monomer composition, RAFT copolymerization is well controlled in the whole range of monomer conversion. However, when MMA is dominant, RAFT copolymerization may be, in some cases, out of control in the late stage of copolymerization, and characterized by a fast increase in the polydispersity index (PDI). The RAFT process was found to have little influence on composition evolution during copolymerization.

The peroxide was decomposed both thermally and photochemically. Experiments on the composition of the polymer as a function of the monomer composition have given the reactivity ratios styrene radical-styrene molecule to styrene radical-butyl acrylate molecule as 0\u00b748 and butyl acrylate radical butyl acrylate molecule to butyl acrylate radical to styrene molecule as 0\u00b715. The kinetics of the copolymerization have been determined, and using the theory already elaborated for the treatment of such reactions, it has been shown by rate and molecular weight measurements that the styrene radicals react with the butyl acrylate radicals more quickly than the mean rate of reaction of styrene to styrene and butyl acrylate to butyl acrylate radicals. The coefficient \u00d8 defining this increased activity is not in this case constant and rises with increasing styrene content to a value of as much as 150. The initiation mechanism is also complicated in that there is no linear relation between the rate of initiation and monomer composition; instead, the rate drops rapidly when styrene is added to the butyl acrylate.</jats:p>",

In the St\u2010VA system, the large difference between the reactivity ratios of the two monomers causes a large error limit in values of 4, so that we could not find any essential regularities in the variation of 4 with successive mixing ratios. In the MM\u2010St system, however, where the difference of the two reactivity ratios is not so large, we can determine the values of 4 more precisely and obtain a concrete confirmation of Arlman's theory. As a result, we conclude that, for the MM\u2010St system (at. 24\u00b0C.), the termination constants for mixed radicals are larger than those for homogeneous radicals, and, furthermore, that the rate constant for a normal cross\u2010termination reaction is about 3 times larger than that of the cross\u2010termination reaction having a penultimate unit.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A generally applicable computational procedure, which permits the accurate evaluation of the kinetic parameters of intricate and extended copolymerization schemes to be made, is described. This method is based on a numerical integration of the differential equation, and, according to the (improved) curve\u2010fitting I procedure, experimental errors in both measured variables are considered. Furthermore, a description is given of the<jats:italic>F</jats:italic>test, in which a statistical comparison between the resulting residual sums of squares of two different schemes offers a possibility of selecting the most probable kinetic scheme for a given copolymerization system. The capability and applicability of the methods developed is demonstrated for the free radical copolymerization kinetics of methyl acrylate (MA) (M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and butadiene (BD) (M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) with toluene as solvent. Here, the simple copolymer equation is unsatisfactory because a significant penultimate unit effect in BD macroradical reactivity shows up:<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>222</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>221</jats:sub>= 0.84, and<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>122</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>121</jats:sub>= 0.53, and<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>11</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>k</jats:italic><jats:sub>12</jats:sub>= 0.088.

Statistical considerations indicate a strongly diminished probability of finding BD (<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) in the vinyl configuration in \u223c<jats:italic>mb</jats:italic>\u223c transitions. Steric hindrance or polar repulsion of the ester side group of the penultimate MA unit probably account for the increased preference for monomer addition to the C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>site over the C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>site of the BD macroradical.</jats:p>",

In contrast to the experiences made with methacrylates there was no decrease in the polymerization rates up to 50 mol\u2010% of AMo or EOEA in the monomer mixture. This behavior was ascribed to a compensation of the lack of thermal initiation by the high propagation rate constants of the acrylates. The produced AB diblock polymers were successfully employed in block extension reactions in styrene yielding ABA triblock polymers. Copolymerization reactivity ratios (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>\u2010values) and glass transition temperatures have been estimated.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>Monomer structures.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/gif\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.gif\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>Monomer structures.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

Due to the above reasons, the AG model was recast and was subsequently used with terpolymerization data directly to estimate ternary reactivity ratios under the error\u2010in\u2010variables\u2010model framework, based both on instantaneous (low conversion) and cumulative composition data (medium and high conversions). Several examples and counter examples highlight such important issues as the choice of the correct number of responses, accounting for the appropriate error structure, and incorporating the right information content, all with diagnostic checks whose target is the eventual reliability of the reactivity ratio estimates. \u00a9 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 60: 1752\u20131766, 2014</jats:p>",

The results of the comparisons suggest that retrospective analyses of existing copolymerization data should only be done with a nonlinear least\u2010squares analysis. For new data, the design of experiments is of great importance, and when done properly allows the use of some of the linear least\u2010squares methods of analysis.</jats:p>",

In order to compute the reactivity ratios, we determined the copolymer composition by microanalysis of the carbon content. The evaluation of the data was carried out according to two procedures; the Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u00f6s linearization method and the non\u2010linear least\u2010squares of Tidwell and Mortimer.

Different kinetic models were tested to describe the observed dependence of reaction rate on monomer mixture composition. The experimental results could be successfully described according to a kinetic model that assumes diffusion control of the termination reaction. The resulting kinetic equation contains two parameters whose values were determined from the experimental copolymerization rates. The value of one of these parameters could be obtained also from homopolymerization data for styrene. This proves that the parameters have physical significance and are not arbitrary quantities chosen to fit the experimental results.</jats:p>",

The results obtained from the copolymerization of ST with CMA in 1,4\u2010dioxane in the absence of a radical initiator are as follows: the copolymerization is strongly accelerated by UV\u2010irradiation; the monomer reactivity ratios of ST and CMA at 60\u00b0C are 0,06 and 0,00, respectively; the over\u2010all activation energy of the copolymerization is 77,4 kJ \u00b7 mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> (18,5 kcal \u00b7 mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>); the maximum rate of copolymerization at a constant total monomer concentration is observed at a mole fraction of ST of 0,4 to 0,5. The rate of copolymerization at equimolar feed composition is of second order with respect to the total monomer concentration. From the results obtained here and shown in the preceding paper, it was inferred that initiating radicals for the spontaneous copolymerization are formed through a charge transfer (CT) complex between the comonomers.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>4-Acryloyl-1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-piperidinol (APMP) is a reactive hindered amine that prolongs the service life of the polymeric materials and exhibits high stability, good resistance to extraction, and low toxicity. In this paper, a photoinduced free radical copolymerization of APMP and methyl methacrylate (MMA) is accomplished at ambient temperature in solution. APMP plays a key role in the copolymerization, owing to the nitroxides generated in situ from the moiety of 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-piperidine under UV irradiation, and mediates the copolymerization, which is confirmed by the linear kinetics. With the increment of initial monomer feed ratios of APMP/MMA, both the copolymerization rate and the average molecular weight increase. According to the reactivity ratios from the extended Kelen-T\u00fcdos (KT) method at high conversion by<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy, a nonlinear model is established and the sequential distribution in the copolymers is also investigated. The dispersion of APMP units is regulated by the feed ratios and reactivity ratios.</jats:p>",

The copolymers always contain the two monomer units in 1:1 ratio. Thus styrene, copolymerized with methyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate in the presence of ethylaluminum sesquichloride in homogeneous toluene solution, gives such an equimolar copolymer regardless of the initial monomer compositions. The NMR spectra of these copolymers are distinctly different from those of the equimolar copolymers obtained with azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator and have simpler and well separated patterns. The copolymers and the corresponding radical copolymers appear to be amorphous, judged by their x\u2010ray diffraction patterns and their differential thermal analyses. Their infrared spectra resemble each other very closely. Hence, the difference in the NMR spectra may be ascribed to the matter of the sequence distribution.

Monomer reactivity ratios are found as <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>Aam</jats:sub> = 0.085 \u00b1 0.020, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>VB</jats:sub> = 2.0 \u00b1 0.33. Although the terminal model describes the composition data well, it is seen to be inconsistent with the reaction rates. This discrepancy is attributed to implicit penultimate effects and using the recently developed calculation method, effective radical reactivity ratios are found as <jats:italic>s</jats:italic><jats:sub>VB</jats:sub> = 0.26 and <jats:italic>s</jats:italic><jats:sub>Aam</jats:sub> = 0.027, and both composition and rate data fit the implicit penultimate model extremely well. On\u2010line monitored data showed that in the reactions where the VB was completely consumed, the subsequent Aam homopolymerization was very rapid; thus, the reaction showed definitely two rate regimes, before and after VB depletion. Acrylamide take up rate also showed these two rate regimes. We conclude that low conversion results can be misleading and reactions must be monitored up to a high conversion for a robust control of composition and reaction kinetics. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Title": "Kinetics of polymerization of vinylidene chloride. IV. Copolymerization of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile",
        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The emulsion polymerization of vinylidene chloride is divisible into three stages: (I) a normal emulsion polymerization at a rate dependent on the 0.6 power of both the catalyst and surfactant concentration; (II) at a rate less than half that of I; (III) at a rate which increases in direct proportion to the catalyst concentration and independently of surfactant concentration. A careful examination of stirring rate has shown that the slowdown in stage II probably results from monomer starvation caused by slow diffusion of coalesced droplets, and that recovery in stage III is the result of transfer of monomer at the time of collision between a polymer particle and a monomer droplet. Extension of this work to copolymers of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile has shown a similar kinetic effect at high ratios of vinylidene chloride. The rate of polymerization for a system containing 90% vinylidene chloride decreases sharply after 15% conversion. The polymer formed increases in acrylonitrile content with conversion, reaches a maximum, and then decreases during stage III of the reaction. A run containing 70% vinylidene chloride in the charge did not show a slowdown but gave evidence of a maximum in the curve relating conversion and composition. At higher acrylonitrile content, no slowing occurred, and the polymer composition changed monotonically with conversion. Since acrylonitrile is partially soluble in water, the partition coefficient of acrylonitrile between vinylidene chloride and water was determined at concentrations similar to those used in the polymerizations. The partition coefficient decreases with increasing acrylonitrile concentration in the water phase. Apparent reactivity ratios were calculated on the basis of the monomer composition corrected for the water solubility of acrylonitrile and the initial composition of the copolymer. These values are <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.390 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.585, vinylidene chloride being considered to be the first monomer. The existence of a unique reactivity ratio indicates that the composition of the initial polymer is controlled only by the relative reactivities of the comonomers and the water solubility of acrylonitrile. The polymer formed later is also influenced by the rate of transport of vinylidene chloride to the reaction site. This is confirmed by the conversion curves and the manner in which composition changes with conversion.</jats:p>",

The homopolymerization of these monomers in toluene and their copolymerization with styrene in acetone were carried out with azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator. The rate of polymerization of the nitroalkyl acrylates showed a correlation with the number of nitro groups situated on the ester side chain. The apparent activation energies of the polymerization were found to be 22.0\u201327.5 kcal./mole for the nitroalkyl acrylates and about 11.5\u201313.0 kcal./mole for the nitroalkyl methacrylates. From the reactivity ratios and Q\u2010e values of the copolymerization the following information was obtained. The copolymerization behavior of nitroalkyl acrylates and methacrylates showed an alternating tendency, and these monomers belong to the conjugative monomer groups. On the reactivities of these monomers, the polarity of vinyl group was affected a little by nitro group of ester bond side, and the resonance affected little. These monomers were crosslinked with 2\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010nitro\u20101,3\u2010propylene diacrylate. Some of the polymers showed marked improvement in the physical properties of elastomers.</jats:p>",

The monomers were obtained by acylation of 3\u2010methyl\u20101\u2010phenyl\u2010pyrazolone\u20105 with crotonyl chloride or cinnamoyl chloride, respectively. It was established that the two monomers do not homopolymerize either under the action of ionic and radical initiators nor with \u03b3\u2010rays (doses between 2 and 10 MRad). In contrast to this, the two monomers copolymerize with other vinyl comonomers.

The reaction was conducted in three stages; a further stage (called the steady stage, 2 h) was added to the traditionally stages (i.e., feed and seed stages) to improve considerably the monomer conversion. The monomer conversion and particle size distribution were studied by gravimetric and laser light scattering methods, respectively. The effects of variables such as agitation speed, emulsifier concentration, initiator concentration, feeding rate and comonomers ratio were fully investigated based on the monomer conversion\u2010time profiles and the particle size distribution to find the optimized copolymerization conditions. Increasing the agitation speed had a negative effect on the monomer conversion, but reduced coagulation of polymer particles. Monomer conversion could be improved by increasing the initiator or emulsifier contents. Feeding rate increased the polymer particle size sharply; however, it showed no significant effect on conversion. The final conversions were as high as 97\u201399% and they were recognized to be independent of the comonomers ratios employed. Morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy showed nano\u2010sized isolated particles which were partially aggregated. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010</jats:p>",

        "Title": "Accurate Determination of Reactivity Ratios for Copolymerization Reactions with Reversible Propagation Mechanisms",
        "Abstract": "<jats:p>An understanding of monomer sequence is required to predict and engineer the properties of copolymers. Typically, comonomer sequence is inferred or determined from reactivity ratios, which are measured through copolymerization experiments. The accurate determination of reactivity ratios from copolymerizations where one or both monomers undergo reversible propagation, however, has been complicated by difficulty in solving the underlying population balance equations, the presence of myriad copolymer equations in the literature derived under varying assumptions and simplifications, and lack of an easy to fit integrated model. Here, we rectify and assert the consistency between previously reported copolymer equations of disparate form, introduce a new method to explicitly solve the underlying population balance equations, and perform stochastic copolymerization simulations to evaluate the ability of these three methods to produce consistent comonomer consumption predictions and fits to simulated copolymerization data. We find that all methods produce consistent predictions given the same input parameters, which implies both accuracy and precision when modeling copolymerization, fitting experimental data, and making predictions of comonomer sequence. Considering this consistency, we make a recommendation to use numerical integration of the appropriate copolymer equation to fit real copolymerization data due to its ease of implementation and single subjective parameter for implementation. We further identify the minimum number of parameters required for accurate data fitting and suggest ways to measure other information ex situ from copolymerization to expediate accurate fitting. Finally, the practical utility of the methods developed herein is demonstrated through fitting seven distinct copolymerization datasets which span a wide range of copolymerization reactivities.</jats:p>",

This technique was used because it allowed us to individually map out the monomer conversions of St and IA during the course of the polymerization at various conversions. This was possible because the individual contributions to the overall monomer conversion from St and IA could be measured through their nonoverlapping vinylic proton signals. The results of monomer conversion during the time in the corresponding <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectra was the basis of our analysis to determine the reactivity ratios of St and IA in the solution and radical copolymerization reaction by several methods.

The reaction mechanisms are discussed. The reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of the VPDC\u2013MMA system were determined as follows:\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nThe difference between the reactivity between the liquid\u2010phase (25\u00b0C) and solid\u2010phase (\u221278\u00b0C) copolymerization is mainly attributable to the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> value. The behavior of the liquid\u2010phase copolymerization of the VPDC\u2013St system was anomalous, the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> value being negative in the range from 0 to 80 mole\u2010% of VPDC monomer.

Neither the rate of copolymerization nor viscosity number of the copolymer formed were influenced by the presence of air in the reaction system. The result of copolymerization in the ternary system involving methyl acrylate (MA) could not be entirely explained by the copolymerization equation given by Alfrey and Goldfinger for the three component system. It was found that the composition of the copolymer formed changed with the solvent dilution. Formation of 1 : 1 molecular complex between the monomers was evidenced by the application of the continuous variation method to \u03b1-MeSt-CAL system.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Polyacrylonitrile is an important polymer that is widely used in the manufacture of synthetic fibers, particularly for applications in apparel. Although a vast amount of literature is available on the polymerization process of acrylonitrile (AN) with other monomers, there are few reports of studies on polymerization in a mixed solvent of water with an organic solvent. It is conceivable that this method could combine the advantages of the solution and suspension polymerization methods. Synthesis of AN copolymers with two vinyl acids, methacrylic acid (MAA) and itaconic acid (IA), is carried out by solvent\u2013water suspension polymerization. The polymerizations are performed with an equal ratio mixture of dimethylformamide as a solvent and water as a nonsolvent at 60\u00b0C using \u03b1,\u03b1\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator. The kinetics of polymerization are studied by plotting the conversion versus reaction time for different mole ratios of AN with vinyl acids. Copolymers are characterized by FTIR and capillary viscometery. The results show that IA depresses the rate of polymerization more than MAA in this reaction medium, and this effect becomes more significant at higher vinyl acid mole ratios. High conversion in a short reaction time is obtainable for copolymers with a low vinyl acid mole fraction. However, for mole ratios of more than 93:7, the rate of the reaction is drastically reduced and low conversion (&lt;60%) results, even after 8 h. The intrinsic viscosities of all cases are surprisingly high. Although they are reduced with increasing acidic comonomer mole fraction, this reduction is more significant for IA compared to MAA. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The solubilization sites of the two monomers were determined with an NMR technique. The results showed that the solubilization behaviors of the two monomers were quite different. Most of the styrene was solubilized in the palisade layer of the microemulsion, whereas the acrylonitrile had an equilibrium distribution in the aqueous phase and palisade layer of the microemulsion. The reactivity ratios of styrene and acrylonitrile in the microemulsion system were different from those in other media. The effect of the monomer feed composition on the copolymerization kinetics was investigated, and the mechanism of nucleation of the latex particles was examined. The experimental results showed that the copolymerization loci were changed from the microemulsion droplets to the aqueous phase when the concentration of acrylonitrile in the monomer feed reached approximately 80%; this could be further proved by the effect of the monomer feed composition on the copolymerization kinetics. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The addition of the Lewis acid Et<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>AlCl increased the copolymerization rate and enhanced the incorporation of \u03b2\u2010pinene. The first example for the synthesis of an almost perfectly alternating copolymer of \u03b2\u2010pinene and acrylonitrile was achieved in the presence of Et<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>AlCl. Furthermore, the possible controlled copolymerization of \u03b2\u2010pinene and acrylonitrile was then attempted via the reversible addition\u2013fragmentation transfer (RAFT) technique.

However, the living character could be observed only within certain monomer conversions. At higher monomer conversions, the copolymerizations deviated from the living behavior, probably because of the competitive degradative chain transfer of \u03b2\u2010pinene. The \u03b2\u2010pinene/acrylonitrile copolymers with a high alternation degree and controlled molecular weight were also obtained by the combination of the RAFT agent cumyl dithiobenzoate and Lewis acid Et<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>AlCl. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A series of new copolymers with desired thermal stability and mechanical properties for applications in leather industry were synthesized from various substituted maleimides and alkyl acrylates. Polymerization was carried out by a free\u2010radical polymerization using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as initiator. The monomers and polymers synthesized were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Interestingly, these polymers were soluble in common organic solvents. Copolymer composition and reactivity ratios were determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectra. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography. The homo\u2010 and copolymer of maleimide showed single\u2010stage decomposition (ranging from 300\u2013580\u00b0C). The initial decomposition temperatures of poly[<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010(phenyl)maleimide] [poly(PM)], poly[<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u20104\u2010(methylphenyl)maleimide] [poly(MPM)] and poly[<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u20103\u2010(chlorophenyl)maleimide] [poly(CPM)] were higher compared to those of the copolymers. Heat\u2010resistant adhesives such as blends of epoxy resin with phenyl\u2010substituted maleimide<jats:italic>\u2010co\u2010</jats:italic>glycidyl methacrylate copolymers with improved adhesion property were developed. Different adhesive formulations of these copolymaleimides were prepared by curing with diethanolamine at two different temperatures (30\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C). \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Then, the influence of several pertinent parameters, such as emulsifier concentration, amount of initiator, monomer\u2010to\u2010water ratio and addition of an organic solvent has been examined in relation to the actual polymerization mechanism.</jats:p>",

Since both VS and VE undergo alternative copolymerization with MAn, these terpolymerizations were approximately treated on the basis of the free propagation and complex propagation mechanisms. From the treatment of the free propagation mechanism in which only three free monomers can participate, the reactivity of the free VS toward attack of the poly(MAn) radical was found to be 4.24 to 6.63 times higher than that of free VE, and the difference in activation energy was 1.5 kcal/mole. The higher reactivity of VS than VE might be explained by the 3 d orbital resonance between the propagating radical and the adjacent sulfur atom in VS. According to the complex propagation mechanism in which only two complexed monomers can participate, the reactivity ratios of the MAn/VS and MAn/VE complex monomers were also determined. It was found that the former complex was more reactive than the latter complex toward the poly(MAn) radical.</jats:p>",

In contrast, poly(vinyl alcohol) emulsifier gave an initial polymerization of vinyl acetate at a rate equal to or greater than that of the n\u2010butyl acrylate up to 7\u201337% conversion; then, the n\u2010butyl acrylate polymerized preferentially until it became depleted, followed by the remaining vinyl acetate, to give a vinyl acetate\u2010rich copolymer and poly(vinyl acetate), as expected from the copolymerization reactivity ratios.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The graft copolymerization of acrylamide\u2013methylacrylate comonomers was carried out using ceric ammonium nitrate as initiator in the presence of nitric acid at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. The effects of feed molarity, feed composition, reaction time, and temperature on graft yield (%<jats:italic>G</jats:italic>) and other grafting parameters were investigated. The determination of rate of ceric (IV) ions disappearance as a function of feed molarity and reaction time was useful in the determination of the rate of ceric (IV) ions consumption during graft copolymerization. The graft yield (%<jats:italic>G</jats:italic>) in the presence of acrylamide increases because of the synergistic effect of acrylamide comonomer. The composition of the grafted chains (<jats:italic>F</jats:italic><jats:sub>AAm</jats:sub>) varies on varying the feed composition and reaction temperature but is almost constant during feed molarity variation. The Mayo and Lewis method was used to determine the reactivity ratios of acrylamide (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and methylacrylate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), which are 0.65 and 1.07, respectively. The product of reactivity ratio (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\n<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is less then unity; hence, an alternate arrangement of comonomer blocks in the grafted copolymer chain is proposed. The rate of graft copolymerization of comonomers onto cellulose is second power to the concentration of comonomers and square root to the concentration of ceric ammonium nitrate. Suitable reaction steps for graft copolymerization of comonomers onto cellulose are proposed. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 86: 2631\u20132642, 2002</jats:p>",

The corresponding reactivity ratios were evaluated by Fineman\u2013Ross, Kelen T\u00fcdos, and error\u2010in\u2010variables model (RREVM) methods. The reactivity ratios obtained (r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 1) show that alternating copolymers were produced. These results are best explained if the copolymerizations proceed through highly polarized radical transition states rather than styrene\u2013maleic anhydride charge\u2010transfer complexes. Polar solvents stabilize highly polarized radical transition states thereby promoting alternating polymerization at higher temperatures than can be observed in nonpolar solvents. Donor solvents might also stabilize the electrophilic maleic anhydride radical more than the nucleophilic styryl radical thereby tending to depress k<jats:sub>21</jats:sub> relative to k<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>. The copolymerizations were also studied in decalin (a nonpolar, nondonor solvent) at 60\u2010145\u00b0C. At lower temperatures alternating copolymers were combined. However, at temperatures &gt; 120\u00b0C, random copolymers were obtained in decalin. Thus, in decalin, styrene\u2013maleic anhydride charge\u2010transfer complexes are present at lower temperatures where they might play a role in alternation. In decalin the solvation of the polar transition states (relative to the macroradicals and monomers) does not favor copolymerization through such dipolar structures. Thus, at low temperatures growing chains could add to charge\u2010transfer complexes. However, at temperatures above 120\u00b0C the concentration of charge\u2010transfer complexes becomes so small that they can no longer be kinetically important contributions to the copolymerization. Thus, random copolymers with high styrene mole ratios are produced in decalin. The equilibrium constants for complex formation between maleic anhydride and both 1,3\u2010dimethoxybenzene and 1,2,4\u2010trimethoxybenzene were de\u2010termined in 1 : 1 (v/v) CCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/CDCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> using a technique based on changes in the NMR chemical shifts of the maleic anhydride protons. \u00a9 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The changes in the values of the reactivity ratios are connected with the ability of the solvents to govern the formation of hydrogen bonds among the MMI molecules and between the MMI and the solvent on the one hand and the formation of donor\u2010acceptor associates between both monomer molecules on the other. The increase of the concentration of associated monomer molecules which occur in chloroform leads to a decrease of the r\u2010values.</jats:p>",

The observed dependence of the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> values on the nature of the solvent is surprisingly large and can be correlated with the volume changes (= excess volumes) observed on mixing vinyl acetate (VAc) with the relevant solvent. An increased hydrogen bonding or dipole\u2013dipole interaction through the carbonyl moiety of the acetate side group of VAc, induces a decreased electron density on the vinyl group of VAc, which in turn leads to a decreased VAc reactivity. The differences among the overall rates of copolymerization in the various solvents can be interpreted in terms of a variable chain transfer to solvent and the rate of the subsequent reinitiation by the solvent radical. In the case of benzene, complex formation is believed to play an important part.</jats:p>",

In the copolymerization of vinyl cyclohexane with acrylonitrile the copolymer composition depends on the ratio of acrylonitrile to AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. If this ratio is unity, alternating copolymers of the composition 1:1 are formed; with a ratio greater than unity statistical copolymers that contain more than 50% acrylonitrile units are produced. The <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectroscopy measurements indicate that the interaction between the comonomers and the complexing agent leads to the formation of ternary donor\u2013acceptor complexes of equimolar composition. The equilibrium constants of these complexes at \u221260\u00b0C have been determined. The effects of temperature, nature of solvent and dilution on the yield, and composition of the copolymers of vinyl cyclohexane with acrylonitrile formed have been studied. By lowering the temperature the yield of copolymers increases but their composition remains equimolar. An increase in the polarity of the medium results in an increase in copolymer yield, whereas the yield decreases if the reaction is conducted in a donor\u2010solvent medium. Dilution of the reaction mixture disrupts the alternation of units in the macrochain of copolymers. The kinetic pecularities of copolymerization have been investigated. The linear dependence of the copolymerization rate on the product of comonomer concentration is observed. The rate of copolymerization is proportional to the square root of the incident light intensity. Various additions of radical type and irradiation accelerate the process of copolymerization. The mechanism of alternating copolymerization of vinyl cyclohexane monomers with acrylonitrile in the presence of AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is discussed in terms of homopolymerization of the comonomer complex.</jats:p>",

The results of the comparisons suggest that the new equation is satisfactory. \u00a9 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With a Monte Carlo simulationmethod, copolymer properties have been thoroughly studied, and the influence of the reactivity ratios and feed composition has been taken into consideration. Instantaneous alterations of the copolymer composition and copolymer heterogeneity, which is also called a randomness parameter, have been examined with data obtained from the simulation at each stage of the copolymerization reaction. The results prove the azeotropic behavior of copolymerization reactions in which both reactivity ratios are greater than unity, although some special reactivity ratio combinations ignore the azeotropic behavior. The copolymer composition reaches an azeotrope point at the end of the copolymerization reaction when the copolymerization is an azeotropic reaction. In addition, the randomness parameter takes its maximum value at the azeotrope point when reactivity ratio <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>A</jats:sub></jats:italic> is equal to reactivity ratio <jats:italic>r<jats:sub>B</jats:sub></jats:italic>.

A convenient laboratory procedure for the sodium-catalyzed copolymerization of butadiene and styrene has been described. Earlier attempts to accomplish this probably failed because the monomers were not sufficiently pure. 2. The copolymer of butadiene and styrene which results from sodium polymerization is different from the emulsion copolymer, GR-S, in several important respects. The sodium-catalyzed copolymer has a more nearly constant styrene content at different stages of conversion; it is made up of molecules with a relatively narrow molecular weight spread; it has a higher intrinsic viscosity; it is 100 per cent soluble in benzene (i.e., there is no gel) even at 100 per cent conversion; when treated with standard rubber antioxidant, it ages better; and it has a greater amount of the butadiene joined in the 1,2 manner (i.e., greater vinyl side-chain content). 3. The effects of such variables as temperature of polymerization, method of adding the monomer mixture to the catalyst, size of catalyst particles, and possible butadiene impurities on the polymerization have been studied. 4. The method has been extended to cover copolymerization of butadiene and m-methylstyrene to give a soluble copolymer of low molecular weight. Other styrene-type monomers gave less interesting copolymers.</jats:p>",

A heretofore unrecognized possibility for approaching the problem of general monomer reactivity relationships appears to lie in the consideration of terpolymers. The relationship between monomer and terpolymer compositions is given by the equations\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nA more general and yet simplified relationship underlying terpolymers which has not been previously recognized is derived. This relationship is shown to hold for a wide range of monomer types and concentrations. The overall probability of initiating a, c, and b sequences immediately preceded by b, a, and c, respectively, and of undefined terminating units is equal to the probability of terminating a, c, and b sequences with b, a, and c units, respectively, but of undefined initiating units. This relationship of product probabilities is as follows:\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nand is shown to hold for numerous terpolymer and related copolymer systems. It follows that\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nMethods are presented for predicting the behavior of monomers A and C in copolymerization when the behaviors of A\u2010B and B\u2010C are known. Furthermore, it is shown that the value of eq. (3) is frequently in the range of 0.02\u20130.06. This result is probably related to the fact that terpolymerization of monomers of equal reactivity in equimolar concentrations will yield product probabilities equal to 0.037.

Recent work by Graham et al. has demonstrated that this is untrue for monomers of extremely dissimilar polarities. In this paper the kinetics of copolymerization of dissimilar monomers has been developed. As a result it is shown that the ratio of monomers in the initial copolymer <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>[M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>]/<jats:italic>d</jats:italic>[M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] is directly proportional to the square of the initial monomer ratio ([M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>]/[M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>])<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> when the monomers are dissimilar.

The conclusion is drawn that values of <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> of 1.0 and 2.0 represent extremes of behavior for monomers of very similar and very dissimilar polarites. As a corollary of this it is concluded that reactivity ratios for these systems where <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> is not 1.0 are of questionable theoretical significance.</jats:p>",

The hydrosoluble yields in final latexes are not larger than 1.3\u20135%, depending on the concentration of NaMA used. Below 25% conversion, the change of conversion with reaction time follows the square rule and the particle size is proportional to the 2/3 power of time. Above 25% conversion, serious gel effect occurs, and the conversion follows the seventh power on time and the growth of particle diameter obeys the 2.5 power on time. The multiple glass transition (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>g</jats:italic></jats:sub>) occur below 20% conversion, where monomer droplets exist.

Terminal, penultimate, and \u201ccomplex\u201d copolymerization models were applied by using the data of composition of the copolymers obtained in bulk and by copolymerization in benzene, ethyl acetate, and chloroform. The model based on the participation of the monomer complexes describes satisfactorily the deviation from the terminal copolymerization model. The proton NMR analyses of the monomer mixtures indicate that the interaction between the monomers leads to the formation of weak monomer complexes. Kinetic studies of the initial rate dependence on the total monomer concentration and monomer feed composition enabled us to evaluate the degree of participation of the free uncomplexed monomers and the monomer complex in the propagation reactions. The contribution of the complexed monomers in the propagation stages increases with the increase in total monomer concentration. The initial rate of the copolymerization is proportional to the square root of the initiator concentration, thus confirming the bimolecular termination of the macrochains. The rate constants of the addition reactions of the complex and free monomers were evaluated from the kinetic studies. The quantitative kinetic treatment provided information regarding the relative weight of the termination reaction and indicated that the termination in the system occurs predominantly by the cross\u2010termination reaction between two growing polymer radicals with different kinds of monomer units at the ends. Additional information on the termination in this system was obtained from viscosity measurements.</jats:p>",

The various probabilities include the possibilities of adding A, B, or C monomers to any of the corresponding radicals and can be expressed in terms of binary reactivity ratios. At equimolar concentrations it is shown that for systems of three conjugated or three unconjugated monomers  approximates 0.037. Similarly, for systems of two conjugated and one unconjugated monomers or two unconjugated and one conjugated monomers  approximates 0.006. Once the appropriateness of these constants is established, it is shown how the relationship may be used to assess the most probable values among widely varying reported reactivity ratios. It is shown that the values of the constant  for different combinations of monomers allow the assessment of the reactivity of conjugated monomers compared with unconjugated monomers for conjugated or unconjugated radicals. It develops that the reactivity of unconjugated monomers is between 5 and 10% of that of conjugated monomers for unconjugated radicals. For more precise assessment of unknown reactivity ratios it is suggested that  is a product function of unique reactivity parameters characteristic of the individual monomers involved.</jats:p>",

The values of the copolymerization parameters calculated from the monomer reactivity ratios were <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> = +0.6 and <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> = 1.4. Comparison of the monomer reactivities indicates that SEM is similar to ethyl methacrylate with regard to copolymerization reactivity in 1,2\u2010dimethoxyethane solution.

This decreased reactivity was attributed to greater ionic repulsion between reacting species in the aqueous medium.</jats:p>",

The decomposition of benzoyl peroxide and tert.\u2010butyl peroxide in acroleindiethylacetal has been studied in the liquid phase. On the basis of the obtained products a mechanism is proposed which involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a primary radical from a carbon atom which is adjacent to oxygen. We also tried to copolymerize the acetal with several conventional comonomers but copolymers were only obtained when acrylonitrile and maleic anhydride were used. The remarkably uniform composition of the copolymers from the acetal and maleic anhydride is explained through a donor\u2010acceptor complex between the two monomers.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the molecular weights of the resulting poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010TFMA) copolymers were in good agreement with the theoretical values for feed of TFMA/VDF ratios that ranged from 50/50 to 0/100 mol %, showing that TFMA does not disturb the controlled radical polymerization of VDF.

The results on the control of the copolymerization were compared to those obtained with and without the presences of TFMA and surfactant. The addition of a low amount of TFMA improved the control of the polymerization of VDF without using any surfactant. Also, the size of particles, assessed by light scattering, was smaller than 200 nm. The addition of TFMA in low proportions, that is, 5 to 10 mol %, enabled us to stabilize the particle size and to decrease the size by one order of magnitude. The emulsifying behavior of TFMA (in low amount in the copolymer, that is, &lt;10 mol %) was similar to those achieved when a surfactant was added. Indeed, neither sedimentation nor destabilization was observed after several days.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The kinetics of the graft copolymerization of styrene onto methyl acrylate (MA) and methyl methacrylate copolymers (MMA) containing <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl perester groups have been studied. The synthesis of these perester copolymers was carried out in two steps: (<jats:italic>1</jats:italic>) copolymerization of acrylyl chloride with methyl (meth)acrylate, and (<jats:italic>2</jats:italic>) reaction of the acrylyl chloride copolymer with <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl hydroperoxide. Further, these perester copolymers were usually treated with diazomethane in order to methylate any carboxylic group which might be present. The graft copolymers were separated from both hompolymers by progressive precipitation on addition of methanol to the chloroform solution of the copolymers. The stability of these perester copolymers has been considered and found to depend on whether there are acid groups in the copolymer. The first\u2010order rate constants and the activation energy of decomposition in the absence of acid groups have been evaluated. These values depend on the molar composition of the copolymer; an induced decomposition of peresters is favored by a high perester content, which is responsible for a decrease in <jats:italic>E<jats:sub>a</jats:sub></jats:italic> (26.8 instead of 29.6 kcal./mole). In the presence of free carboxylic groups, some of the perester groups decompose very rapidly, the energy of activation of their decomposition being only 15 instead of 25.6 kcal./mole for the slow step. The degree of conversion attained during the rapid step is a function of the stereochemical structure of the copolymer, and the rate of decomposition is much higher than that produced by the addition of external acid. With the MA perester the rate of grafting is proportional to the square root of the perester concentration while it is first order with respect to the monomer concentration. These dependences were found to hold also for the overall rate of polymerization (from the total weight increase) as well as for the grafting rate (from the isolated graft copolymer and its styrene content). The styrene content of the graft copolymer increases with monomer concentration (e.g., 53.8 and 75.3 for monomer concentrations of 2.6 and 6.1 moles/l., respectively). At low monomer concentration, grafting is greatly favored over homopolymerization; it is also enhanced by the viscosity of the solution. With the MMA perester also, the grafting rate obeys the square root law for the perester concentration and the first\u2010order dependence on monomer. However, the rate of grafting is practically independent of the styrene concentration over a large range. The relative importance of grafting over homopolymerization is in this case much less than with MA\u2010TBP, except at high dilution. Different interpretations are suggested in order to explain the very high and sometimes very low values of <jats:italic>R<jats:sub>g</jats:sub>/R<jats:sub>h</jats:sub></jats:italic>, the ratio of the rate of grafting to the rate of hompolymerization. The different behaviors of the MA and MMA peresters are discussed.</jats:p>",

The polymerization showed the characteristics of \u2018living\u2019 free radical polymerization behaviors: first order kinetics, linear relationships between molecular weight and conversion, and narrow polydispersity of the polymers. The reactivity ratios of NVC and VAc were calculated via the Kelen\u2013Tudos (KT) and non\u2010linear error in variable (EVM) methods and showed as <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>\u2009=\u20091.938\u2009\u00b1\u20090.191, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\u2009=\u20090.116\u2009\u00b1\u20090.106. The thermal behavior of the copolymers with different content of NVC and VAc was investigated by DSC and TGA. The results showed that the introduction of a VAc segment into copolymer significantly reduced the <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub> of the NVC homopolymers. FT\u2010IR spectra, fluorescence spectra, and cyclic voltammetric behavior of these copolymers were also measured and compared with those of NVC homopolymers. The copolymers showed similar oxidative behavior to the NVC homopolymer. However, there was only one reductive potential peak shown for the copolymers at about 0.058 V.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Two new techniques for the determination of monomer reactivity ratios in copolymerization under high\u2010pressure conditions have been developed, viz., the \u201csandwich\u201d and the \u201cquenching\u201d method. Both methods are based on repeated quantitative gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture during the low\u2010pressure stages preceding and succeeding the high\u2010pressure stage, of which the kinetics is under investigation. Application of the \u201csandwich\u201d method implies the occurrence of reaction during both low\u2010pressure stages and consequently the low\u2010pressure kinetic data are required to obtain the transition points of low to high pressure and vice versa. These points constitute the initial and final conditions of the relevant high\u2010pressure reaction. On the contrary, in the \u201cquenching\u201d method no reaction occurs during the low\u2010pressure stages, owing to the lower temperature and the high activation energy of the initiator decomposition. As a consequence, the initial and final conditions of the high\u2010pressure stage can be determined by a simple averaging procedure. Both methods have been tested for the ethylene\u2014vinyl acetate copolymerization at 62\u00b0C and 600 kg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> with <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl alcohol as solvent, and appear to lead to almost identical monomer reactivity ratios, although the \u201cquenching\u201d method is slightly preferred in case of copolymerization reactions. Both methods are particularly valuable when one of the reactants is gaseous or the reaction produces a gas. Further merits and drawbacks of both methods are discussed.</jats:p>",

The bulk and solution free\u2010radical polymerizations of this monomer were studied. Traditional bulk free\u2010radical polymerization kinetics were observed, giving polymers with \u3008<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>n</jats:sub>\u3009 values of 21 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> to 48 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> g/mol (where <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>n</jats:sub> is the number\u2010average molecular weight) and polydispersity indices near 1.5. In solution polymerization, polymers with higher molecular weights were obtained in cyclohexane than in tetrahydrofuran (THF) because of the higher chain transfer to the solvent. The chain\u2010transfer constants calculated for cyclohexane and THF were 1.97 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> and 5.77 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup>, respectively. To further tailor polymer properties, we also completed copolymerization studies with styrene. Kinetic studies showed that BMAMBD incorporated into the polymer chain at a faster rate than styrene. With the Mayo\u2013Lewis equation, the monomer reactivity ratios of BMAMBD and styrene at 75 \u00b0C were determined to be 2.6 \u00b1 0.3 and 0.28 \u00b1 0.02, respectively. Altering the composition of BMAMBD in the copolymer from 17 to 93% caused the glass\u2010transition temperature of the resulting copolymer to decrease from 64 to \u22127 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Copolymer properties and processability depend on copolymer microstructure, i.e., copolymer composition and monomer unit arrangements along the copolymer chains. To predict the ultimate properties of copolymers, one needs complete information on the length and position of sequences of each monomer type in every chain. A versatile kinetic Monte Carlo code is developed and applied for the simulation of typical free radical copolymerizations. The code allows explicit monitoring of every growing chain during the course and at the end of polymerization, can account for comonomer systems of any arbitrary reactivity ratios (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) over the full range of monomer composition. Meanwhile, it eliminates the need for solving arrays of differential equations arising from deterministic modeling approaches. Since the code virtually synthesizes billions of copolymer molecules and keeps in storage information on each and every copolymer chain in the system, it allows for detailed statistical analysis. The simulator visualizes the bivariate sequence length\u2013chain length distribution for typical copolymerization systems and examples with: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> &lt; 1 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 1; <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> &gt; 1 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; 1; (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> \u00d7 <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) = 1; and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 1, and is also applied successfully to an experimental scenario described in the literature.</jats:p>",

If it is assumed that the ceric ions, which are reduced at an accelerated rate in the early stages of reaction with SCP, do not participate in the graft formation, a relation is observed between the modified amount of reduced ceric ion and the number of grafted chains formed, and the molar ratios of these quantities are 12:1 without irradiation and 75:1 to 100:1 with irradiation.

To evaluate the potential of the obtained materials as dispersants, the effect of the polymer concentration on the dispersion of copper nanopowders in organic solvents is studied for a copolymer with a 1\u2010octene composition of 25 mol%.</jats:p>",

The grafting efficiency and homogeneity of copolymer were determined by the fractionation and measurement of dynamic viscoelasticity of emulsion polymers. As the content of the second fraction of acetone\u2010soluble part increased and that of the third fraction decreased, then the homogeneity of the copolymer increased, In this case, only one dynamic loss peak existed near 0\u00b0C. The result showed that homogeneous copolymers were obtained by continuous monomer addition methods and heterogeneous copolymers were obtained by initial addition of total monomers or stepwise monomer addition methods. Homogeneity of copolymer had great influence on various properties, e.g., hardness and adhesive properties. Film hardness was the lowest for homogeneous copolymer and it was the highest for heterogeneous copolymer. Homogeneous copolymer was best for adhering plywood and poly(vinyl chloride). It is remarkable that copolymers of vinyl acetate and butyl acrylate with very different properties were obtained by changing only the monomer addition methods.</jats:p>",

Ethylene\u2013vinyl acetate copolymerization at 62\u00b0C with <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl alcohol as solvent agrees with the proposed scheme, appearing from the pressure independence of the product of reactivity ratios at the different levels (35,600, and 1200 kg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>). Implicitly it can be shown that an ethylene monomer contributes about 2 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/mole more to the activation volumes of the propagation reactions than does the vinyl acetate monomer, whereas for the radicals the difference of the respective contributions to the activation volumes is opposite in sign.</jats:p>",

In order to reduce the viscosity various additives were examined.

Copolymerizations of MAD with cyclohexyl and <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\u2010butyl acrylate resulted in copolymers with \u03c9\u2010unsaturated end groups, and increasing the temperature up to 180 \u00b0C resulted in an increase in the rate of \u03b2 fragmentation of MAD radicals relative to propagation. Only a small amount of unsaturated end groups was introduced by copolymerization with ethyl methacrylate (EMA), and the EMA content in the copolymer increased with temperature. These findings could be explained by the reversible addition of the poly(EMA) radical to MAD. The copolymerization with ethyl \u03b1\u2010ethyl acrylate (EEA) did yield a copolymer containing unsaturated end groups with MAD units as part of the main chain, although the steric hindrance of the ethyl group suppressed homopropagation and crosspropagation of EEA, resulting in low polymerization rates.

Besides the styrenic copolymers, copolymers containing a hard phase of methyl methacylate and methyl acrylate were also synthesized. Comonomer droplets with a narrow size distribution and fair uniformity were prepared using an SPG (Shirasu porous glass) membrane having pore size of 0.90 \u03bcm. After the single\u2010step SPG emulsion, the emulsion droplets were composed mainly of monomers, hydrophobic additives, and an oil\u2010soluble initiator, suspended in the aqueous phase containing a stabilizer and inhibitor. These were then transferred to a reactor, and subsequent suspension polymerization was carried out. Uniform copolymer particles with a mean diameter ranging from 3 to 7 \u03bcm, depending on the recipe, with a narrow particle size distribution and a coefficient of variation of about 10% were achieved. Based on the glass\u2010transition temperatures, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry, the resulting copolymer particles containing a soft phase of acrylate were better compatibilized with a hard phase of methyl methacrylate than with styrene with dioctyl phthalate (DOP) addition. Glass\u2010transition temperatures of poly(MMA\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010MA) particles were strongly affected by the composition drift in the copolymer caused by their substantial difference in reactivity ratios. Incorporation of DOP in the copolymer particles does not significantly affect the glass\u2010transition temperature of MMA\u2010 or MA\u2010containing copolymer particles, but it does affect the St\u2010containing copolymer and particle morphology of the copolymers. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The resulting copolymers consisted of equimolar amount of methyl methacrylate or methacrylonitrile and styrene, regardless of the molar ratio of monomers in the feed. NMR spectroscopy showed the copolymers to have an alternate sequence. The tacticities of the copolymers varied with the complex to have an alternate sequence. The tacticities of the copolymers varied with the complex species: the copolymer from the SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> complex system had a higher cosyndiotactieity, while those from the AlCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and the BF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> complex systems showed coisotacticity to predominate over cosyndiotacticity. NMR spectroscopic investigation of the copolymerization system indicated the presence of a charge\u2010transfer complex between the styrene and the methyl methacrylate coordinated to SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>. The concentration of the charge\u2010transfer complex was estimated to be about 30% of monomer pairs at \u221278\u00b0C at a 1:1 molar ratio of feed. The growing end radicals were identified as a methyl methacrylate radical for the AlCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> complex\u2013styrene system and a styrene radical for the SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> complex\u2013styrene system by the measurement of the ESR spectra of the copolymerization systems under or after irradation with a high\u2010pressure mercury lamp. The tacticity of the resulting polymer appears to be controlled by the structure of the charge transfer complex. In the case of the SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> complex a certain interaction of SnCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> with the growing end radical seems to be a factor controlling the polymer structure. These copolymerizations can be explained by an alternating charge\u2010transfer complex copolymerization scheme.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios of acrylamide and ethyl acrylate were found to be <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.54 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 1.10, respectively, and hence the sequence lengths of acrylamide (m\u0304<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and ethyl acrylate (m\u0304<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) in the grafted chains are arranged in an alternating form, as the product of the reactivity ratios of acrylamide and ethyl acrylate (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> \u00d7 <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is less than unity. The rate of graft copolymerization of the comonomers onto cellulose was found to be dependant on the \u2018squares\u2019 of the concentrations of the comonomers and on the \u2018square root\u2019 of the concentration of ceric ammonium nitrate. The energy of activation (\u0394<jats:italic>E</jats:italic><jats:sub>a</jats:sub>) of graft copolymerzation was found to be 5.57 kJ mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> within the temperature range from 15 to 50 \u00b0C. On the basis of the results, suitable reaction steps have been proposed for the graft copolymerzation of acrylamide and ethyl acrylate comonomers from their mixtures.

Fractionation of the copolymers with acetonitrile and the NMR spectra of the insoluble fractions show that these are block copolymers which consist of a polystyrene portion and a poly(methyl methacrylate) portion. When the copolymerization is stopped at low conversion the copolymer has a high styrene content, which sometimes exceeds the value expected for radical copolymerization. This fact would indicate that styrene is preferentially polymerized at the early stages of chain propagation. When the copolymerization is carried to high conversion some crosslinked polymer is formed which contains more styrene than the soluble part of the same experiment. When a piece of metallic lithium is used as initiator, it is found that the crosslinked polymer is formed on the surface of the metal. The addition of lithium phenoxide or \u03b2\u2010naphthoxide to the system eliminates the formation of crosslinked polymer. A possible mechanism is proposed.</jats:p>",

Therefore, partially fluorinated polymers have recently been reported. As an easy-to-handle fluorine-containing monomer, \u03b1-trifluoromethylstyrene (TFMST) can be used to produce partially fluorinated polymers with trifluoromethyl groups in the main chain; however, TFMST does not homopolymerize, and there are limited reports on its copolymerization with styrene (ST). In this study, we applied the controlled radical polymerization method, which is effective for the polymerization of ST, to the copolymerization of TFMST and ST. We also showed that nitroxide-mediated polymerization is effective. The content ratio of TFMST in the TFMST\u2013ST copolymer can be controlled between 10% and 40% by changing its monomer ratio. Additionally, the polymerization of TFMST and ST with substituents was performed to increase structural variations. The thermal stability as well as water and oil repellency of the synthesized polymers with different composition ratios and substituents were also evaluated.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios for the EHA\u2013VCLAC pair were markedly different so that both propagating chains preferentially add EHA. Both the \u03d5 factor and the penultimate effect models were inadequate for describing the termination reaction. By defining an appropriate expression, based on physicochemical considerations, for the overall termination rate constant, it was possible to model the steady state rates by the diffusion model of Atherton and North. An attempt to model the transient behavior of the reactor by using the \u03d5 value as an adaptable correction factor was unsuccessful due to the rapid composition drift during approach to steady state.

The activity of a catalyst treated by ethylene/1\u2010butene prepolymerization \u201cprep\u2010cat\u20102\u201d for the copolymerization is not affected by the monomer composition in the range of 0\u201310 mol\u2010% of 1\u2010butene, but it is higher than that of the homopolymerization of ethylene with a catalyst treated by ethylene prepolymerization \u201cprep\u2010cat\u20101\u201d. Comparative studies of the polymerizations in the gas\u2010phase and in slurry reactors showed differences in the rate\u2010time profiles. The higher activities in the early stage and declining kinetics for the gas\u2010phase polymerizations can be considered to be due to the higher macroparticle diffusivity and to fast deactivation of the active centres which has been confirmed by the determination of the oxidation state of titanium in the catalyst. Data from determinations of monomer reactivity ratios indicated that the gas\u2010phase process favours the incorporation of 1\u2010butene into the polymer chains.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The principal deficiency of the widely utilized Alfrey<jats:italic>\u2013</jats:italic>Price (AP) scheme for computing reactivity ratios in the widely used free radical copolymerization is that it ignores important factors, such as the steric effects. This often leads to inaccurate reactivity ratio predictions by AP model. Accordingly, in this study, exclusively data-driven,<jats:italic>Q\u2013e</jats:italic>parameter-based new models have been developed for the reactivity ratio prediction in free radical copolymerization. In the model development, a novel artificial intelligence formalism known as \u201c<jats:italic>genetic programming</jats:italic>(GP)\u201d that performs symbolic regression has been employed. The GP-based models possess a different functional form than AP model. Further, parameters of GP-based models were fine-tuned using<jats:italic>Levenberg\u2013Marquardt</jats:italic>(LM) nonlinear regression method. A comparison of AP, GP and GP-LM as well as artificial neural network (ANN)-based models indicates that GP and GP-LM models exhibit superior reactivity ratio prediction accuracy and generalization performance (with correlation coefficient magnitudes close to or greater than 0.9) when compared with AP and ANN models. The GP-based reactivity ratio prediction models developed here due to their higher accuracy and generalization capability have the potential of replacing the widely used AP models.</jats:p>",

In nonpolar media where the gegenion is lithium, a nonhomogeneous distribution exists with the more basic monomer in higher concentration at the growing chain end which shows as an enhanced relative reactivity. This is depressed by the addition of a small amount of more polar solvent. The influence of temperature as a function of solvent has been determined for selected anionic systems. In nonpolar media, an increase of temperature favors incorporation of the less basic monomer whereas a more polar solvent has only a small effect and favors a more ideal copolymerization. In cationic copolymerization the effect of hyperconjugation has been demonstrated. This effect of hyperconjugation appears to be enhanced in polar media. The cationic copolymerizations of styrene with <jats:italic>p\u2010tert</jats:italic>\u2010butylstyrene in nitrobenzene shows a steric hindrance of the bulkier monomer on its incorporation into the copolymer.

The selective hydrolysis of the ethyl ester monomer with trimethylsilyl bromide (TMSBr) gave a phosphonic acid monomer. The attempted bulk polymerizations of the monomers at 57\u201360 \u00b0C with 2,2\u2032\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were unsuccessful; however, the monomers were copolymerized with methyl methacrylate (MMA) in bulk at 60 \u00b0C with AIBN. The resulting copolymers produced chars on burning, showing potential as flame\u2010retardant materials. Additionally, \u03b1\u2010(chloromethyl)acryloyl chloride (CMAC) was reacted with diethyl (hydroxymethyl)phosphonate to obtain a new monomer with identical ester and ether moieties. This monomer was hydrolyzed with TMSBr, homopolymerized, and copolymerized with MMA. The thermal stabilities of the copolymers increased with increasing amounts of the phosphonate monomer in the copolymers. A new route to highly reactive phosphorus\u2010containing acrylate monomers was developed. A new derivative of CMAC with mixed ester and ether groups was synthesized by substitution, first with diethyl (hydroxymethyl)phosphonate and then with sodium acetate. This monomer showed the highest reactivity and gave a crosslinked polymer. The incorporation of an ester group increased the rate of polymerization. The relative reactivities of the synthesized monomers in photopolymerizations were determined and compared with those of the other phosphorous\u2010containing acrylate monomers. Changing the monomer structure allowed control of the polymerization reactivity so that new phosphorus\u2010containing polymers with desirable properties could be obtained. \u00a9 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The protonated membranes were thermally stable up to 320 \u00b0C in air. The water uptake, hydrolytic and oxidative stability, and mechanical properties were evaluated. At 30\u201390 \u00b0C and 95% relative humidity, the proton conductivities of the membranes increased with the sulfonic acid content and temperature and almost reached that of Nafion 112. At 90\u2013130 \u00b0C, without external humidification, the conductivities increased with the temperature and benzoxazole content and reached above 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> S/cm. The SPAEKBO\u2010X membranes, especially those with high benzoxazole compositions, possessed a large amount of strongly bound water (&gt;50%). The experimental results indicate that SPAEKBO\u2010X copolymers are promising for proton\u2010exchange membranes in fuel cells, and their properties might be tailored by the adjustment of the copolymer composition for low temperatures and high humidity or for high temperatures and low humidity; they are especially promising for high\u2010temperature applications. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effect of solvents on the copolymerization of acrylamide and styrene has been studied. Copolymerization to low conversions were run in a variety of solvents which would affect the acrylamide monomer in different ways, i.e., by hydrogen bonding, by dipole\u2013dipole interaction only, or by a combination of both. The effect upon the acrylamide was measured by the shift in the infrared spectra of the amide carbonyl and N\uf8ffH groups. Essentially, both hydrogen bridging and dipole\u2013dipole interaction affect acrylamide in the same way, as manifested by a shift in the amide carbonyl and NH towards the longer wavelength. From the standpoint of acrylamide\u2013styrene copolymerization, the greater the shift in the NH absorption, the smaller is the amount of acrylamide that is found in the copolymer. Thus, by the proper choice of solvent, it is possible to obtain copolymers from the same monomer feed ranging in combined acrylamide from very low to very high, and reactivity ratios for acrylamide also ranging from very low to very high. Conversely, for styrene, activity ratios will range from high to low.</jats:p>",

For comparison, the graft copolymer of iBMA onto polychloroprene (CR) [poly(CR\u2010<jats:italic>g</jats:italic>\u2010iBMA)] was also prepared. The glass transition temperature of the poly(CP\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010iBMA) was about \u221232.4\u00b0C. The monomer reactivity ratios determined by the Finneman\u2010Ross method were given as r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (CP) = 1.80 and r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (iBMA) = 0.74 in the copolymerization of CP and iBMA, respectively. Miscibility of blends of CR and poly(isobutyl methacrylate) (PiBMA), prepared by casting from tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, was investigated by their glass transition temperature behaviors and morphologies. Although the blends of CR and PiBMA were incompatible, the addition of poly(CP\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010iBMA) or poly(CR\u2010<jats:italic>g</jats:italic>\u2010iBMA) enhanced miscibility between the two base polymers.

It is established that to obtain a controlled copolymerization a minimum of 40 mol% of PFS is required, which is significantly greater than other copolymerization systems such as using 4.5\u20138 mol% styrene or 1 mol% of 9\u2010(4\u2010vinylbenzyl)\u20109H\u2010carbazole to control the copolymerization of methacrylates. It is surmised that this lack of control is due to the reactivity ratios that favor the addition of MAA rather than PFS (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>PFS</jats:sub> = 0.14, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MAA</jats:sub> = 6.97).

The polymerization rate and controllability of the heterogeneous ATRP of S and T were regulated by the solubility of Cu(II)/ligand in the reaction mixture, based on a mechanistic analysis and solubility tests of the Cu(II)/ligand system in the reaction media.

The efficiency of the aluminum components in the latter catalyst systems appear to decrease in the following order: AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &gt; Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Et<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>Cl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> \u226b AlEt<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cl(\u226bAlCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). The alkylaluminum halides could also be used effectually in the form of the complex with acrylonitrile. The catalytic activity was markedly affected by the order of mixing of the catalyst components and the monomers. Effective catalysts could be prepared only when the catalyst components were mixed in the presence of acrylonitrile. The catalyst activity was also found to depend upon the Al/V ratio, reaching its maximum when the ratio was about 20 in the AlEtCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\u00b7AN/VO(O<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010Bu)<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> system. Other combinations of conjugated diene with conjugated polar vinyl monomer were similarly copolymerized by these catalysts. It was found that different feed ratios between the diene and the vinyl monomer which were varied over a wide range always resulted in the formation of a 1:1 copolymer. The butadiene\u2010acrylonitrile copolymer thus formed gave an NMR spectrum in which there was only one peak assignable to the methylene protons (7.72 \u03c4) of the butadiene unit. On the basis of these findings, it may be suggested that alternating copolymerization prevails in the polymerization systems here investigated.</jats:p>",

All reactions were monitored online, by an Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization (ACOMP) system. The concentrations of the two comonomers in their monomeric form, as well as their concentrations incorporated into polymer, were obtained from the monitored data. It was seen that Aam homopolymerization was faster than VB and both homopolymerization rates were higher than copolymerization rates at any combination. In the reactions with 1.5%, 5% and 10% (mol) VB, VB was completely depleted and further reaction was Aam homopolymerization. In the copolymerizations with 5 to 50% initial VB content, the plots of VB fraction in the remaining monomer mixture versus conversion exhibited a corner at 10\u201330% conversion. This corner showed that the behavior of the reaction changed abruptly at this point. In the first stage of the reactions, the composition was seen to be almost constant with almost no composition drift whereas in the second part, the VB fraction decreased monotonically. Monomer reactivity ratios (MRR) were calculated by error in variables (EVM) method. Since the reactions gave two distinguishable regions, the reaction part before and after the corner were evaluated separately.

In these solvents, there is a significant effect on the rate of polymerization, on the tacticity of the resulting poly(methacryloyl fluoride), and on the copolymerization of MAF with methyl methacrylate (MMA). The equilibrium constants between MAF and aromatic solvents were determined from NMR spectroscopic measurements. These results indicated that the solvent effect on the MAF polymerization stems from changes in reactivity of MAF induced by the strong MAF\u2013solvent interaction as well as stabilization of the MAF radical by solvents. Copolymerization of MAF with both <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u2010methoxystyrene (MSt) and <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u2010nitrostyrene (NSt) was also studied.</jats:p>",

The presence of oxygen in the system not only caused an induction period but also decreased the average particle size (<jats:italic>D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub></jats:italic>). However increasing AA concentration ([AA]) gave a reduction in the induction period. The FTIR and NMR analysis of the latex copolymer confirmed that the correlation of the copolymer compositions with the feed compositions was much better at the lower [AA] than at the higher levels. The AA contents of the copolymers obtained in air were much lower than those of the copolymers obtained under N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> protection. Decreasing [AA] led to decrease in the copolymer molecular weight and broadening of the molecular weight distribution, but the particle size distribution (\u03b4/<jats:italic>D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub></jats:italic>) was unaffected.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effect of the alkyl group on the relative reactivity of a homologous series of vinyl esters (2) has been studied with ethylene (1) as reference monomer, <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl alcohol as solvent, at 62\u00b0C and 35 kg/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. The experimental method was based on frequent measurement of the monomer feed composition throughout the copolymerization reaction by means of quantitative gas\u2010chromatographic analysis. Highly accurate monomer reactivity ratios were estimated in a statistically justified manner by a nonlinear least\u2010squares method applied to the integrated copolymer equation. The reactivity of the vinyl ester monomers towards an ethylene radical increased with decreasing electron\u2010with\u2010drawing ability of the ester group. All vinyl ester radicals considered turned out to have the same preference for their own monomer over ethylene (constant <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 1.50). Reactivity ratios are discussed in terms of the <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>\u2013<jats:italic>e</jats:italic> scheme and the Taft relation. It appeared that chiefly polar factors contribute to the observed relative reactivity, while probably resonance stabilization only plays a minor part. Steric hindrance seems to impair monomer reactivity, only from vinyl pivalate on. Relative reactivities of the vinyl esters are compared with literature values, where other reference monomers have been used.</jats:p>",

No reasonable copolymerization of glycolide and \u03b2hyphen;propiolactone was obtained at 20\u00b0C in nitrobenzene, whereas all catalysts yielded copolyesters at 100\u00b0C. In the case of glycolide/\u03b3\u2010butyrolactone only bulk copolymerizations at 60\u00b0C with acidic initiators were successful. Under other conditions only homopolymerization of glycolide was observed. Copolymerizations of glycolide and \u03b3\u2010valerolactone were performed in bulk and in nitrobenzene with both acidic and complexing initiators, whereas anionic initiators only caused homopolymerization of glycolide. Acidic initiators favored the incorporation of \u03b4\u2010valerolactone, whereas the complexing initiators favored the incorporation of glycolide. The crystallinity of the glycolide/\u03b4\u2010valerolactone copolymers was characterized by means of differential scanning calorimetry, and a good agreement with the expectations from both molar composition and sequence distribution was found.</jats:p>",

Kinetics of the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) (co)polymerization of styrene (St) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEO5MEMA) was studied by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 1H NMR spectroscopy, which allows calculating not only (co)polymerization parameters but also gives valuable information on RAFT (co)polymerization kinetics, process control, and chain propagation. Molecular weight Mn and dispersity \u0110 of the copolymers were determined by SEC with triple detection. The detailed investigation of styrene and PEO5MEMA (co)polymerization showed that both monomers prefer cross-polymerization due to their low reactivity ratios (r1 &lt; 1, r2 &lt; 1); therefore, the distribution of monomeric units across the copolymer chain of p(St-co-PEO5MEMA) with various compositions is almost ideally statistical or azeotropic. The thermoresponsive properties of p(St-co-PEO5MEMA) copolymers in aqueous solutions as a function of different hydrophilic/hydrophobic substituent ratios were evaluated by measuring the changes in hydrodynamic parameters under applied temperature using the dynamic light scattering method (DLS).</jats:p>",

The maximum rate of homopolymerization of the dimethacrylates followed the order of Bis\u2010GMA &gt; UDMA &gt; TEGDMA &gt; Bis\u2010EMA, and the final degree of conversion of the corresponding homopolymers followed the order of TEGDMA &gt; UDMA &gt; Bis\u2010EMA &gt; Bis\u2010GMA.

An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the propagating polymer radicals was observable in the actual copolymerization system at 50\u00b0C.

Experiments were conducted in bulk, in solution in several solvents, and in the presence of several comonomers. Acetyl peroxide (II) was found to be the most effective of common initiators and was used in most of the experiments. The sealed empoule technique was employed. The bulk polymerization of I is zero order to 60\u201380% conversion; the rate varies as the 0.7 to 0.8 power of the acetyl peroxide concentration, and the over\u2010all activation energy is 17 kcal./mole. The solution polymerization in benzene appears to be first order in monomer; in other solvents the order was not ascertained. The rate and activation energy in solution are solvent dependent and there appears to be an inverse relationship between the rate of polymerization of I in a solvent and the rate of decomposition of II in that solvent. The rate of decomposition of II was measured in a number of solvents and found to vary widely and to parallel, roughly, the rate of decomposition of benzoyl peroxide.

        "Title": "Estimating Reactivity Ratios From Triad Fraction Data",
        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Reactivity ratio estimation is a non\u2010linear estimation problem. Typically, reactivity ratios are estimated using the instantaneous copolymer composition equation, otherwise known as the Mayo\u2010Lewis model, based on low conversion (&lt;5%) copolymer composition data. However, there are other instantaneous models, which can be used to estimate reactivity ratios, such as the instantaneous triad fraction equations. The aim of this paper is to determine the potential improvement in reactivity ratio estimates when triad fraction data is used in place of and in combination with copolymer composition data. The interest in using triad fraction data in parameter estimation, stems from the fact that there are a greater number of responses measured (six triad fractions) compared to composition leading to data with theoretically more information content. In principle this should lead to reactivity ratio estimates having less uncertainty. In this study, the parameter estimates are obtained by employing the error in variables model (EVM), assuming a multiplicative error structure. Several case studies involving published literature data for different copolymer systems are presented. As the case studies demonstrate in general more precise estimates can be obtained from triad fraction data. Combining the triad fraction with composition data leads to little additional improvement. However, discrepancies arise between reactivity ratios estimated from composition data compared with those obtained from triad fraction data depending upon the copolymer system. Those copolymer systems exhibiting more heterogeneity due to phase separation during polymerization may be showing more discrepancy.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrogel copolymers based on N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA) and acrylic acid (AAc) were synthesized using a solution polymerization technique with different monomer ratios and ammonium persulfate as an initiator. This paper investigates the thermal stability, physical and chemical properties of the hydrogel copolymer. Testing includes Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis (CHNS). The copolymer composition was determined by elemental analysis, and the reactivity ratios of monomers were calculated through linearization methods such as Fineman\u2013Ross (FR), inverted Fineman\u2013Ross (IFR), Kelen\u2013Tudos (KT) and Mayo\u2013Lewis (ML). Good agreement was observed between the results of all four methods. The ratio of r1 and r2 were 0.38 (r1) and 1.45 (r2) (FR), 0.38 (r1) and 1.46 (r2) (IFR), 0.38 (r1) and 1.43 (r2) (KT), and 0.38 (r1) and 1.45 (r2) (ML). Hydrogel copolymers exhibited good thermal stability, and SEM showed three-dimensional porous structures. Antibiotic-free and antibiotic-loaded hydrogels demonstrated antimicrobial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. As the ratio of DMA in hydrogel copolymer increased, the activity of copolymer against bacteria enhanced. The results indicated that these hydrogels have the potential to be used as antibacterial materials.</jats:p>",

We adapted a semiempirical kinetic model, previously used for OMA homopolymerization, for the consumption of both OMA and MA monomers with a large difference in their reactivities. The OMA polymerization rate and end conversion showed a similar dependence on the reaction conditions, as described in the first part of this series, for its homopolymerization. Generally, the MA comonomer had an inhibition effect on the OMA polymerization rate. However, an increase in the initial MA concentration resulted in an increased OMA initiation rate. Because of the higher reactivity of OMA compared with that of MA, the OMA conversion began before the MA conversion, and both the initiation and propagation rates were higher than those for MA. The molar ratios of the converted monomers (MA/OMA) were always significantly lower than the corresponding MA/OMA feed fractions. They depended on the reaction conditions used for the copolymerization. In particular, higher oxidant or MA concentrations, higher temperatures, and a 1 M DCl concentration favored MA conversion, that is, its insertion into the copolymer. The MA end conversion was much smaller than that of OMA, only up to 23%; for a low oxidant concentration (oxidant/monomer\u2010deficient molar ratio), it was only 6%. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Under appropriate conditions, around 240 and 200% grafting percentages were achieved for acrylamide and acrylic acid, respectively. The resulting graft copolymers showed much improved affinity for solvents and hygroscopicity compared to the original chitin.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to study methods for estimating copolymerization reactivity ratios based on the differential composition equation. Methodology. Most estimation methods reduce the differential composition equation to a linear form. They are based on the least squares method and do not take into account the measurement error in the input variable. Therefore they lead to statistically incorrect results. When analyzing the problem on the basis of the error-in-variables model in the classical case, additional information is required to determine the magnitude of the errors in measuring the concentration of monomers in the mixture and in the copolymer. Inclusion of the measurement error in the input variable into the model as the Berkson error is more consistent with the actual conditions of the experiments. It allows simultaneous estimating both the reactivity ratios and the variances of measurement errors using the maximum likelihood method. Results. The algorithm have been developed for estimating reactivity ratios with no additional information. The empirical study of estimation methods has been carried out using the example of copolymerization of vinyl esters. Findings. It is shown that the method based on symmetric equations gives incorrect results. Estimation results using the proposed algorithm are closest to the estimates obtained by the nonlinear least squares method</jats:p>",

Due to the isolation of the COOH and COOR groups from the benzene ring owing of the CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> group the electron densities on the polymerizable CC double bonds of these acids, their H\u2010dimers, the H\u2010associates with the solvent and their alkyl esters are identical. In spite of this, however, in the copolymerization of styrene with unsaturated acids the rate of addition to the polymeric radical was fastest for the H\u2010dimers of the acids, less fast for a mixture of H\u2010dimers and H\u2010associates \u201cunsaturated acid\u2010acetic acid\u201d, and slowest for the acid esters. The preferential enrichment of the copolymer with the acid is explained through a bimolecular addition of the first C\uf8feC of the H\u2010dimer to the polymeric radical and a faster \u201cmonomolecular\u201d addition of the C\uf8feC of the second dimer acid unit associated with the polymeric radical. If however, there is some steric hindrance to an immediate radical propagation between the C\uf8feC of two acid units joined by H\u2010bonds between the carboxyl groups, several elementary acts of bimolecular addition of the other comonomer molecules may take place between the addition of the first and the second dimer acid unit.</jats:p>",

Despite extensive partitioning of PEGMA into the water phase, copolymers containing up to 24 mol % PEGMA were formed in the oil phase, from comonomer feeds containing 30 mol % PEGMA. Conversions by suspension polymerization were comparable to those obtained by solution polymerization, at over 70%. Suspension copolymers with high PEGMA contents contained high\u2010molecular\u2010weight polymer formed by uncontrolled polymerization, unless poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was added to displace the growing polymer from the interface. The addition of diethylene glycol dimethacrylate gave capsules at 17 mol % PEGMA with ATRP, whereas conventional free\u2010radical polymerization required 24 mol % PEGMA to form capsules. The lower PEGMA level required for capsule formation with ATRP was attributed to the lower rates of propagation and crosslinking and to improved incorporation of PEGMA into the final gels. Suspension ATRP with 24 mol % PEGMA in the feed gave two\u2010layer capsule walls consisting of an inner layer visible by transmission electron microscopy and an outer layer visible by both transmission electron microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy, which indicated a compositional gradient across the capsule wall. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The copolymerization rate is below the rate of TFE homopolymerization and the copolymerization kinetics depends on the FVE content in the reaction medium. The copolymer composition is very similar if the FVE content in monomer mixture is \u22642.5 mol %. However, the percent amount of FVE in the copolymer, the copolymerization rate, and molecular mass of synthesized copolymers decrease noticeably with increase in the FVE content in the monomer mixture. The constants of copolymerization are <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>= 2.8 (TFE) and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.03 (FVE). The copolymer is a statistical polymer consisting of TFE blocks and individual FVE molecules between the blocks. The average molecular mass of copolymers is significantly less than that of the TFE homopolymer (PTFE) synthesized at the same conditions. The morphologies of PTFE and copolymer powders were investigated by thermomechanical analysis and are not similar. The copolymer has a completely amorphous diblock morphology depending on the FVE content. The introduction of FVE molecules into the copolymer macromolecules is accompanied by reduction of the crystalline portion of copolymer. If the FVE content in copolymer is \u22653.5 mol %, the copolymer macromolecules completely lose the ability to form crystalline portions as a result of their amorphicity. The introduction of up to 2.4 mol % FVE into the copolymer macromolecules yields a highly thermostable and meltable copolymer which can be processed by using the industrial processes used widely for thermoplastics. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010BDFE) copolymers of various aspects (from white powders to yellow viscous liquids) were produced depending on the copolymer compositions. The microstructures of the obtained copolymers were characterized by <jats:sup>19</jats:sup>F and <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy and by elementary analysis and these techniques enabled one to assess the contents of both comonomers in the produced copolymers. VDF was shown to be more incorporated in the copolymer than BDFE. From the extended Kelen and Tudos method, the kinetics of the radical copolymerization led to the determination of the reactivity ratios, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, of both comonomers (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>VDF</jats:sub> = 1.20 \u00b1 0.50 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>BDFE =</jats:sub> 0.40 \u00b1 0.15 at 75 \u00b0C) showing that VDF is more reactive than BDFE.

Statistic cooligomers were produced with molar masses ranging from 1,800 to 5,500 g/mol (assessed by GPC with polystyrene standards). A further evidence of the successful copolymerization was shown by the selective reduction of bromine atoms in poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010BDFE) cooligomers that led to analog PVDF. The thermal properties of the poly(VDF\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010BDFE) cooligomers were also determined and those containing a high VDF amount exhibited a high thermal stability. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The main difference stems from the partial or total solubility of the hydrophilic monomer in the continuous water phase and in some instances also from the formation of water\u2010soluble polymer. The chemical and morphological structure of the polymer particles, beside the comonomer partitioning between water and oil phases, is governed also by the reactivity ratios of comonomer pair and by the extent of the mutual miscibility or phase separation of polymeric material of the particle. Compositional (chemical) heterogeneity of the polymer particles is also influenced by different affinity of the polymer (copolymer) to the water and oil phases. Structurally inhomogeneous polymer product results from the simultaneously proceeding polymerization in the water and oil phases. The polymer product represents a mixture of homopolymer (copolymer) formed in the water phase and of the copolymer (sometimes graft copolymer) formed on the surface of the polymer particles or in the interphase surrounding the polymer particle.</jats:p>",

A series of these copolymers with various sulfonate loads were synthesized using the emulsion polymerization technique with a study of the copolymerization kinetics, monomer reactivity ratio and copolymer properties.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> The copolymerization kinetics are significantly enhanced with an increase of NaSS feed in the polymerization. Monomer reactivity ratios were determined from NMR data by employing the Fineman\u2013Ross and Kelen\u2013T<jats:italic>\u00fc</jats:italic>d<jats:italic>\u00f6</jats:italic>s methods. Styrene (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) and NaSS (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) reactivity ratios are 0.5 and 10, respectively. The colloidal particle size of the copolymers depends upon the NaSS composition. The thermal stability of the copolymers is greatly enhanced with higher NaSS content in the copolymer backbone. Higher glass transition temperatures are observed for the copolymers with higher NaSS content.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> The reactivity ratio values suggest that styrene prefers to form copolymers whereas NaSS produces homopolymers. It is also found that styrene copolymerization with NaSS is only twice as fast as homopolymerization. In contrast, NaSS homopolymerization is ten times faster than NaSS copolymerization with styrene. The NaSS content in the copolymer backbone affects the thermal stability and the glass transition of the copolymers. Copyright \u00a9 2008 Society of Chemical Industry</jats:p>",

The results of homopolymerization show that yields and the degree of polymerization depend on the purity of the monomers, method of polymerization, and the initiator used. With the exception of monomers containing \u03b2\u2010chloroethoxy group attached to the phosphorus atom, polymers obtained from the dialkyl vinyl phosphates had higher molecular weights than the corresponding dialkyl vinyl phosphonates. Dialkyl isopropenyl phosphates polymerized less readily than the dialkyl vinyl phosphates and diethyl styryl phosphate did not polymerize at all. An attempt is made to explain these results in terms of steric hindrance, charge distribution, and chain transfer. Examination of the copolymerization products, with a number of techniques used, indicates that these consist of polymers with a wide range of compositions and molecular weights. The copolymers with methyl methacrylate appear to consist of a large block of poly(methyl methacrylate) at one end and a smaller block of polymer formed from the vinyl phosphate or phosphonate at the other. Similar conclusions are drawn about copolymers involving styrene. It is likely that the monomer units in copolymers with vinyl acetate are randomly distributed.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Vinyl ester\u2010based monomers for radical photopolymerization have recently been shown to be promising alternatives to (meth)acrylates through lower irritancy and cytotoxicity. Vinyl ester monomers are becoming increasingly important on account of new, more cost\u2010efficient synthetic production methods, not to forget their increased reactivity and improved material properties in combination with thiol\u2013ene polymerization. Due to their biocompatibility and degradability, these monomers are more frequently used in tissue engineering. Nevertheless, the material properties can be improved by possible copolymerizations with other monomers. Therefore, the copolymerization behavior of vinyl ester with norbornene, allyl ether and allyl ester has been studied fundamentally in a photoreactor via free radical photopolymerization. Here, the consumption of double bonds of the monomers has been identified using NMR spectroscopy. Copolymerization parameters have been determined using the Kelen\u2013T\u00fcd\u00f6s method. Results show equal consumption of vinyl ester and co\u2010monomer double bonds leading to alternating copolymerizations. The double bond conversion was confirmed via <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> real\u2010time near\u2010infrared photorheology. Mono\u2010 and difunctional vinyl esters with co\u2010monomers have also provided further insight into the polymer network of these copolymers. \u00a9 2021 The Authors. <jats:italic>Polymer International</jats:italic> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Industrial Chemistry.</jats:p>",

The contents of methyl methacrylate in the copolymers obtained at a [ZnCl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>]/[MMA] molar ratio of 0.4 are systematically larger than 53 mole %, which is the limiting value at a small feed ratio of methyl methacrylate. The resulting copolymers are confirmed as the sole products and not the mixtures by thin layer chromatography. The effect of dilution of the monomer feed mixture with toluene on copolymer composition suggests that it depends chiefly on the feed concentration of styrene and hardly at all on monomer feed ratios. Copolymerizations are also conducted in the presence of stannic chloride at \u221217\u00b0C under photoirradiation and in the presence of ethylaluminium sesquichloride at 0\u00b0C with spontaneous initiation. The contents of methyl methacrylate in both copolymers obtained at feed ratios lower than 60 mole % almost correspond to the 1:1 alternating copolymer and increase systematically with higher feed ratios. The systematic deviations of copolymer composition obtained in the presence of metal halides are reasonably interpreted by the participation of the binary molecular complex composed of metal halide and methyl methacrylate in the polymerization of the ternary molecular complex composed of metal halide, methyl methacrylate, and styrene.</jats:p>",

The relative intensities of three peaks of the splitting signal for the methoxy protons in the nonalternating copolymers obtained by the use of benzoyl peroxide in the absence of metal halides agree well with the cotacticity distribution calculated theoretically by the Lewis\u2010Mayo mechanism with the stereoregulation following Bernoullian statistics.

Reactivity ratios for ethylene and 1\u2010hexene were estimated by the fitting of reactant liquid\u2010phase compositional data to the Mayo\u2013Lewis equation. It was found that a value of the 1\u2010hexene reactivity ratio could not be unequivocally determined from the set of samples analyzed because the range of comonomer incorporation was too narrow. Stockmayer's bivariate distribution was used to model the fractionation process in CRYSTAF, and although a good fit to experimental CRYSTAF profiles was attained, the model did not fully describe the underlying crystallization phenomena. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two monomers (DTCS and styrene) showed equal reactivity toward both propagating species, and the copolymer composition was the same as the comonomer feed. This result means that both the branching and chain length of the hyperbranched molecules can be controlled statistically by the feed monomer ratios.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effect of conjugation on the reactivity of perfluorinated diolefins has been little investigated. A characteristic representative of this class of compounds is hexafluorobutadiene, the activity of which in polymerization reactions is much less than that of tetrafluoroethylene. There is an inadequacy of published data on the polymerization of hexafluorobutadiene. We have investigated the conditions for the polymerization of this compound and have found that it takes place only in emulsions in the presence of a cationactive emulsifier in acid medium (pH 1\u20133) in the presence of a radical type of initiator. The effect of the basic parameters on the emulsion polymerization was investigated. The hexafluorobutadiene polymer obtained in emulsion, in contrast to the polytetrafluoroethylene, is characterized by a low melting point and little stability. It is insoluble in most organic solvents. To ascertain the relative activity of hexafluorobutadiene as compared with other dienic compounds a study was made of copolymerization with chloroprene, fluoroprene, and isoprene, both in emulsion and in solution, and the reactivity constants were determined. The monomer reactivity ratios of the systems are as follows. Chloroprene\u2010hexaflurobutadiene: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.1; fluoroprene\u2010hexafluorobutadiene: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 2.93, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.24; isoprene\u2010hexafluorobutadiene: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 1.19, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.78. On the basis of the monomer reactivity ratios in the monomer\u2010hexafluorobutadiene systems and of reported data on the ratios for chloroprene\u2010fluoroprene and isoprene\u2010fluoroprene copolymerization, the relative reactivity of the monomers was calculated with respect to a common radical, the relative reactivity constant of the radical and its monomer being taken as unity. Chloroprene is 10 times more active than hexafluorobutadiene with respect to the radical of the latter; it is 8 times as reactive as isoprene and 2.4 times as reactive as fluoroprene. The results are in conformity with data on the separate polymerization of the monomers in emulsion. The considerable fall in activity of hexafluorobutadiene in polymerization and copolymerization reactions can probably be interpreted by localization of \u03c0\u2010electrons at the double\u2010bonded carbon atoms and weakening of the conjugation effect owing to a shift in electron density to the highly polar fluorine atom. Similar effects were observed for hexafluorobutadiene in diene synthesis.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The free radical copolymerization of electron-acceptor and electron-donor vinyl monomers represents a particular case of sequence-controlled polymerization. The reactions of maleic anhydride (MA) or related compounds (acceptor comonomers) with \u03b1-olefins (donor comonomers) result in the formation of the alternating copolymers that have clear prospects for petrochemical and biomedical applications. However, in contrast to the well-established polymerization of acrylate monomers, these processes have not been studied theoretically using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In our research, we performed a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the free radical copolymerization of MA and closely related maleimide with different structural types of olefins at mpw1pw91/6-311g(d) level of the DFT. The results of our calculations clearly indicated the preference of the alternating reaction mode for the copolymerization of MA with \u03b1-olefins, isobutylene and prospective unsaturated monomers, as well as methylenealkanes. The DFT modeling of the thermally induced Alder-ene reaction between MA and olefins allowed to exclude this reaction from the scope of possible side processes at moderately high temperatures. Comparative analysis of MA and N-methylmaleimide (MMI) reactivity shown that the use of MMI instead of MA makes no sense in terms of the reaction rate and selectivity.</jats:p>",

The heat of copolymerization decreased almost linearly with the increase in diethyl fumarate content in the copolymer. The heat of homopolymerization for diethyl fumarate was equal to 15.5 \u00b1 0.3 kcal/mole. Monomer reactivity ratios at 100\u00b0C were also determined. The rate of copolymerization was followed over the whole range of conversion. A gel effect was noticed in copolymerizations at lower but not at higher temperatures. The initial rate of copolymerization exhibited a maximum at an intermediate monomer feed composition, differing from the previously reported tendency. The difference was found to be due to the method used for determining the rate of copolymerization, and the superiority of the DSC method was proved. The mechanism of the radical\u2010radical termination process was discussed. From the viewpoint of chemically controlled termination, the cross\u2010termination factor \u03d5 was estimated to be 2.0, which is reasonable considering the steric hindrance; assumption of the predominance of a diffusion\u2010controlled termination reaction was also consistent with the results.</jats:p>",

Varying the AUNa concentration, stable particles bearing only carboxylic charges have been produced with diameters ranging from 200 to 500 nm at solids content as high as 40%. However a low AUNa yield at the particle surface has been found (30\u201335%), which could be explained by very unfavorable reactivity ratios of AUNa with S and BuA. Most of the AUNa seems to be wasted in the water phase (unpolymerized and forming hydrosoluble chains). Furthermore, a concentration of AUNa higher than 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> mol L<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> results in the latex destabilization, presumably caused by the formation of a large amount of polyelectrolytes. Kinetic studies of the AUNa consumption show that the AUNa is mainly fixed at the particle surface between 90 and 100% conversion, which indicates that the AUNa is mainly polymerized in the water phase and not at the particle surface. An attempt has been made to increase the surface charge density by polymerizing a shell of AUNa/S/BuA on a seed latex. It turned out to be unsuccessful (low surface yield, formation of new particles).</jats:p>",

Vital clues regarding the development and the structure of the network were obtained from the study of copolymerization kinetics of styrene/VE systems. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to obtain the individual fraction conversion rates of both the monomers. The conversion versus time data for both styrene and VE was fit to an autocatalytic kinetic model. The autocatalytic model was found to adequately replicate the kinetic data over the entire life of cure. In this investigation, the effects of styrene concentration, temperature, catalyst concentration, and initiator concentration on cure kinetics of styrene/VE systems were studied. The conversion profiles of both styrene and VE were used to obtain the reactivity ratios of the two monomers. The reactivity ratios were evaluated to be close to zero, suggesting that initially alternating copolymerization is favored over homopolymerization. The cure behavior of vinyl\u2010ester resins is affected not only by the chemical reactivity of the monomers toward the free radicals, but also by diffusion effects, phase separation, and microgel formation. The interplay of these factors controls the kinetics of cure, thereby affecting the physical and chemical properties of the resulting polymer.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>New copolymers based on vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene (1234yf) were synthesized by organometallic-mediated radical copolymerization (OMRcP) using the combination of bis(tert-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate initiator and bis(acetylacetonato)cobalt(II), (Co(acac)2) as a controlling agent. Kinetics studies of the copolymerization of the fluoroalkenes copolymers were monitored by GPC and 19F NMR with molar masses up to 12,200 g/mol and dispersities (\u0110) ranging from 1.33 to 1.47. Such an OMRcP behaves as a controlled copolymerization, evidenced by the molar mass of the resulting copolymer-monomer conversion linear relationship. The reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers were determined by using the Fineman-Ross and Kelen-T\u00fcdos fitting model leading to rVDF = 0.384 \u00b1 0.013 and r1234yf = 2.147 \u00b1 0.129 at 60 \u00b0C, showing that a lower reactivity of VDF integrated in the copolymer to a greater extent leads to the production of gradient or pseudo-diblock copolymers. In addition, the Q (0.03) and e (0.06 and 0.94) parameters were assessed, as well as the dyad statistic distributions and mean square sequence lengths of PVDF and P1234yf.</jats:p>",

The homopolymerization of neither monomer was observed in this system. In the \u03b3\u2010ray\u2010initiated copolymerization the <jats:italic>G</jats:italic> value (polymerized monomer molecules per 100 e.v.) was shown to be between 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> and 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup>. It was found that the dose rate exponent of the rate is approximately unity, and the rate is proportional to the amount of ethylene monomer. Apparent activation energies of 1.8 and 27.5 kcal./mole were obtained for \u03b3\u2010ray\u2010initiated and AIBN\u2010initiated copolymerization, respectively. Since the composition of copolymer is independent of monomer molar ratio and the molar ratio of ethylene to maleic anhydride in the polymer is approximately unity, the monomer reactivity ratios were obtained as <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>E</jats:italic></jats:sub> \u2243 0 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>M</jats:italic></jats:sub> \u2243 0 for \u03b3\u2010ray\u2010initiated polymerization at 40\u00b0C. Alternating copolymerization was, therefore, concluded to occur. Infrared analysis of the copolymer is almost consistent with this. The copolymer in the solid state is amorphous. It is soluble in water, cyclohexane, and dimethylformamide and insoluble in lower alcohols, ether, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The aqueous solution of polymer gave a strong acid.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Anionic polyelectrolytes can be used for a variety of applications, including flocculation and enhanced oil recovery. While it is widely recognized that polyelectrolyte synthesis is impacted by the pre\u2010polymer formulation and polymerization conditions, the specific relationships between these factors and the subsequent polymer properties are not well understood. Therefore, the current work intends to improve understanding of ionic strength (IS) effects during the copolymerization of 2\u2010acrylamido\u20102\u2010methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) and acrylamide (AAm). The aims of the study are i) to use in situ H<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> NMR to study copolymerization kinetics, and ii) to determine how increasing IS impacts copolymerization kinetics (and, by extension copolymer microstructure). It is found that altering IS prior to copolymerization has significant impacts on the reactivity ratios, and therefore impacts the microstructure through multiple mechanisms. Increasing IS causes a crowding effect, where the propagating chain develops a random coil conformation and causes steric hindrance of the large AMPS monomer, decreasing the likelihood of AMPS propagation. When the IS is increased further, the ionic shielding effect is more impactful, increasing the likelihood of AMPS propagation. Ultimately, this work will make it possible to manipulate IS to synthesize AMPS/AAm copolymers with specific desirable properties for target applications.</jats:p>",

Methylaluminoxane (MAO) was used as cocatalyst. The activity of the catalyst was higher in copolymerization of ethylene and propylene (EPR) rather than in terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene and diene monomers. The effects of [Al] : [Zr] molar ratio, polymerization temperature, pressure ratio of ethylene/propylene and the ENB concentration on the terpolymerization behavior were studied. The highest productivity of the catalyst was obtained at 60\u00b0C, [Al] : [Zr] molar ratios of 750 : 1 and 500 : 1 for copolymerization and terpolymerization, respectively. Increasing the molar ratio of [Al] : [Zr] up to 500 : 1 increased the ethylene and ENB contents of the terpolymers, while beyond this ratio the productivity of the catalyst dropped, leading to lower ethylene and ENB contents. Terpolymerization was carried out batchwise at temperatures from 40 to 70\u00b0C. Rate time profiles of the polymerization were a decay type for both copolymerization and terpolymerization.

To probe the sensitivity of the copolymerization to the catalyst structure, a series of CuBBIM catalysts with various steric, electronic, and geometric ligand characteristics was prepared, including CuBBIMs having benzimidazole ring substituents and ligand backbones of various lengths. Four different acrylates were also evaluated as comonomers (<jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010butyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010butyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate). Although no obvious ligand\u2010based influences on copolymerization were identified, the structure of the acrylate comonomer was found to exert significant effects. Copolymers prepared with <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>\u2010butyl methacrylate comonomer exhibited the highest ethylene contents (31\u201363%), whereas those prepared with methyl acrylate contained only minor amounts of ethylene (&lt;15%).

Unusual ketoester structures were also observed in the methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate containing copolymers, suggesting that the acrylate ester group size may be an important controlling factor for copolymerization. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

From these values Price <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>e</jats:italic> values, respectively, calculated for SAS were 0.19 and 0.22 in DMSO at pH 7, 0.14 and 0.18 in aqueous DMSO, and 0.18 and 0.70 in DMSO at pH 1.5. The large differences in reactivity of SAS may be attributed to the different electron distributions in SAS in each solvent which are caused by the poor solvating power of dimethyl sulfoxide and by the addition of protons. In copolymerization in aqueous solution, the physical condition depends upon the content of SAS in the monomer feed, and SAS is copolymerized to only a small extent in the range of heterogeneous systems, whereas SAS is copolymerized rather well in the range of homogeneous systems. Homopolymerization of SAS shows a first\u2010order dependence on initiator concentration and a three\u2010halves\u2010order dependence on monomer concentration; this is attributed to degradative chain transfer of SAS. Rates of copolymerization of AN and SAS decrease with increasing SAS content.</jats:p>",

A maximum percentage grafting of 24% was obtained after the optimization of various reaction parameters, including the reaction time, temperature, and concentrations of nitric acid, initiator, and monomer. The graft copolymers obtained under the optimum conditions were then subjected to the evaluation of different physicochemical properties, including swelling behavior in different solvents, moisture absorption behavior under different humidity levels, and chemical resistance. The graft copolymers were further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis), and X\u2010ray diffraction techniques. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Confidence contours in parameter space are a helpful tool to compare and classify determined estimators. For more intricate parameter estimations of nonlinear nature or complex error structures, the procedure of determining confidence contours is a statistically complex task. For polymer chemists, such particular cases are encountered in determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization. Hereby, determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization requires nonlinear parameter estimation. Additionally, data may possess (possibly correlated) errors in both dependent and independent variables. A common approach for such nonlinear estimations is the error\u2010in\u2010variables model yielding statistically unbiased estimators. Regarding reactivity ratios, to date published procedures neglect the non\u2010Gaussian structure of the error estimates that is a consequence of the nonlinearity of the model. In this publication, this issue is addressed by employing a Bayesian hierarchical model, which correctly propagates the errors of all variables. The statistical procedure is discussed in chemist friendly language to encourage confident usage of the tool. The approach is based on a <jats:styled-content>Python</jats:styled-content> program requiring minimal installation effort. A detailed manual of the code is included in the appendix\u00a0of this work, in an effort to make this procedure available to all interested polymer\u00a0chemists.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>This work deals with design of maleimide monomer toward more precise control of alternating sequence for radical copolymerization with styrene. Crucial in this study is sequence analysis by MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS for resultant copolymers that was obtained via ruthenium\u2010catalyzed living radical copolymerization with a malonate\u2010based alkyl halide initiator showing selective initiation ability. The copolymers of a simple <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010alkyl maleimide [e.g., <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010ethyl maleimide (EMI)] with styrene gave complicated peak patterns for the MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS spectra indicating low degree of alternating sequence, in contrary to expectation from the reactivity ratios (almost zero). A simple substitution of methyl group (CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>) of EMI with trifluoromethyl (CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>: CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\u2010MI) made the peak patterns much simpler giving the copolymer with higher alternating sequence. More interestingly, the peak interval of the copolymer at earlier polymerization stage was equal to sum of the molecular weights of CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\u2010MI and styrene, suggesting possibility of the pair propagation of the monomers. Indeed, <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR analyses of the mixture of maleimide with styrene suggested stronger interaction of CF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\u2010MI than EMI. Based on the results, maleimide derivatives carrying a substituent\u2010designable electron\u2010withdrawing group [ROC(\uf8feO)N\u2013: R = substituent] were newly designed toward incorporation of functional side chains. They also gave higher alternating sequence for the copolymerization with styrene. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Problems in literature, as well as possible pitfalls when using available statistical programs that are in itself correct are pointed out. These problems mainly involve (knowledge of) the error structure, as the error structure determines the weighting scheme of the data points in fitting procedures. A simple, robust, statistically correct non\u2010linear least squares (NLLS) method is reintroduced which is based on the visualization of the sum of squares of residuals in the so\u2010called sum of squares space (SSS). The advantages of this method include the fact that the method is easy to understand and can be implemented in simple computer programs, as well as the fact that the method allows important aspects of the error structure to be incorporated. Furthermore, in the SSS the joint confidence interval (JCI) with exact shape can be constructed. The exact shape of the JCI is not always ellipsoidal and following a normal distribution, depending on the linearity of the fitted equations. This can sometimes lead to wrong conclusions.</jats:p>",

All the obtained copolymers displayed unimodal and narrow molecular weights distributions (MWDs). These facts show that the copolymers are most likely to have randomness with respect to monomer sequences. The copolymers obtained with BF<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>OEt<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> as an initiator, in contrast, had relatively high molecular weights (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 21,900 \u2212 37,200) and broad MWDs (<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub>/<jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>n</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 4.10 \u2212 6.31), which are rather suitable for molding of plastic materials. For the copolymer with the pendant urethane linkages, the existence of hydrogen bonding via urethane linkages among the polymer chains was detected. For the copolymers with the pendant acrylate or methacrylate group, exothermic peaks due to cross\u2010linking reaction were observed at around 150\u00b0C on the heating scan during the DSC measurement and therefore, they formed cross\u2010linked polymers during the molding process above this temperature. Both the hydrogen bonds and the cross\u2010linkages provide the copolymers with good processability and hardness. The optical properties of these copolymers were excellent and similar to those of poly(TCDVE). The transparency (86\u201391%) and refractive index (1.53\u20131.54) of these molded samples were similar to those of conventional optical plastics such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC), whereas their specific gravity (1.08\u20131.12) and water absorption (0.08\u20130.16%) were significantly lower than those of PMMA and PC.

The group B monomers are conjugated vinyl compounds having nitrile or carbonyl groups in the conjugated position and form complexes with alkylaluminum halides. The group A monomers are donor monomers having low values, such as olefins, haloolefins, dienes, and unsaturated esters. These A monomers belong to the same group of monomers which give alternating copolymers in conventional radical copolymerization with maleic anhydride, SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and so on. In addition the complexed copolymerization has the same specific characteristics as the conventional alternating copolymerization, i.e., high reactivities of allyl\u2010resonance monomers and inner olefins and no transfer of halogen atom to the copolymers in CCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>.

The reactivity ratios of these monomers given by Cain were verified. The reciprocal intrinsic viscosity of the copolymer was found to be linearly related to the monomer feed composition.</jats:p>",

Such a mild deposition method is used to limit monomer fragmentations and favor cross\u2010linked structures formed through the unsaturated carbon double bond polymerization. The kinetics of deposition, and the dependence of the chemical and physical properties of the films on the comonomer ratio are investigated by combining surface and volume\u2010sensitive techniques. In addition, water\u2010stable catechol\u2010bearing terpolymer films are easily produced from a precursor mixture composed of dopamine methacrylamide dissolved in a 50\u2009mol% DMA/EGDMA solution. Finally, it is demonstrated that the developed coatings can be exploited for efficient one\u2010step bioconjugation reaction for potential biological applications.</jats:p>",

DTEM monomers play an important role in this copolymerization system as inimers capable of initiating living radical polymerization of the vinyl group. Two monomers (DTEM and EMA) showed almost equal reactivity toward both propagating species, and the copolymer composition was the same as the comonomer feed. This result means that both the branching and chain length of the hyperbranched molecules can be controlled statistically by the feed monomer ratios. The compact nature of the hyperbranched macromolecules is demonstrated by comparison of their solution properties with the linear analogues.

The copolymerization reactivity ratios deterined according to the Kelen\u2010T\u00fcd\u0151 method were: r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 1.35, r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.22 for the MA\u2010AAm pair, and r<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 1.75, r<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.10 for the AA\u2010AAm pair. It has been established that the polymerization rate depends both on the composition of the starting reaction mixture and on the reaction temperature. The differential kinetic curves obtained are unimodal ones, suggesting the occurrence of only one process, i.e. copolymerization. A second maximum in these curves, appearing at elevated temperature, is explained by crosslinking and formation of a water\u2010insoluble fraction. The copolymers obtained are white powders; in contrast to their water\u2010insoluble fractions, the water\u2010soluble ones are not toxic but they are less active as immunomodulators.</jats:p>",

It was found that the activity enhances sharply as Ti content decreases from 0.6 to 0.07 wt %, and shows no significant changes in the Ti content range of 0.6\u20135.0 wt %. The maximum activity (36 kg PE/mmol Ti \u00d7 h \u00d7 bar C<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) was observed for TMC with the lowest Ti content.

New data on the effect of hydrogen on MWD of PE have been found. Increasing hydrogen concentration results in broadening the MWD of PE, especially in the case of TMC with high titanium content. The data presented indicate the heterogeneity of active centers of TMC in the reaction of chain transfer with hydrogen. The data on the ethylene\u2013hexene\u20101 copolymerization over TMC with different titanium content are presented. Comonomer reactivity ratios were shown to be independent of the Ti content in TMC. Presumably the difference in activity of these catalysts is mainly caused by the difference in the number of active centers. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We have studied the copolymerization of methacrylate esters, especially methyl methacrylate, with sodium, methacrylate, the former being maintained in a fine particle size with the aid of a water\u2010soluble colloid and rapid stirring. Results have been reproducible. Analytical methods have been worked out for each monomer in the presence of the other, in order to follow the course of the reaction. Several ratios of methyl methacrylate and sodium methacrylate have been investigated under semi\u2010adiabatic conditions, using a persulfate as polymerization initiator. When the two monomers are polymerized together equimolecular ratios, there is a period of inhibition or retardation only in respect of the sodium methacrylate, but this can be avoided by adding methyl methacrylate to sodium methacrylate at incipient polymerization of the latter. It has been possible to deduce a general picture of polymerization, which is as follow: The polymerization of methyl methacrylate follows zero\u2010order kinetics for a large part of the reaction, while that of sodium methacrylate follows first\u2010order kinetics. On increased dilution of the system, the rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate is increased. On the one hand, increase of methyl methacrylate keeping water and sodium methacrylate constant results in little difference in the rate of polymerization of sodium methacrylate or on the proportional rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate. On the other hand, the actual rate of polymerization of methyl methacrylate is doubled. \u03b2\u2010Ethoxy ethyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate copolymerize to a lesser extent with sodium methacrylate in the examined ratios. In these cases a larger proportion of the sodium methacrylate remains unpolymerized when polymerized of the ester is virtually complete. Copolymerization is virtually nil between butyl and sodium methacrylates. The possible mechanism of the copolymerization is discussed.</jats:p>",

The molecular weight of the copolymers is rather low, and the copolymers are suitable as prepared for direct use as coating vehicles. In the system of acetylene and 1,3\u2010dienes, the order of the copolymerization rate decreases in the following order: butadiene &gt; isoprene &gt; 2,3\u2010dimethylbutadiene &gt; chloroprene. 1,3\u2010Dienes substituted at 1\u2010and/or 4\u2010position were scarcely copolymerized with acetylene. Methylacetylene and dienes tend to form cyclized copolymers. In the system of phenylacetylene and dienes, polyphenylacetylene was the main product; the copolymer was not obtained. The copolymer composition and the sequence distribution of linear copolymers were evaluated by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H\u2010NMR spectra. Comparison of dyad fractions of copolymers evaluated from NMR spectra and those calculated by assuming random polymerization indicated that the copolymers of acetylene and dienes were random, and that the copolymers of methylacetylene and dienes were somewhat blocky. The coordination of monomers on the catalyst may play an important role in controlling the copolymerizability.</jats:p>",

Carbon monoxide copolymerized with difficulty with ethylenimine with \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\u2010azobisisobutyronitrile as radical initiator. In the presence of a small amount of ethylene, however, a remarkable amount of crystalline powdery poly\u2010\u03b2\u2010alanine (nylon 3) was obtained. The crystalline copolymer, which mainly consists of nylon 3 and contains a small amount of nylon 5 and other substances of higher homologous nylon structure, was obtained in the presence of a large amount of ethylene. This copolymer scarcely contained any ketone structure. Increasing the total feed of the equimolar mixture of the monomers increased the conversion of total monomer and nylon 3 content in the copolymer formed. The effect of increasing carbon monoxide content in this system was to increase both the conversion and the nylon 3 content in the copolymer. In both cases the copolymers were almost identical with nylon 3. Increased ethylene content in the monomer feed, however, increased the conversion and the content of higher homologous nylon structures, such as nylon 5 and 7. From the results it was concluded that ethylene was involved not only in the propagation reaction but also particularly in the initiation reaction.</jats:p>",

The rate of copolymerization of I (R = Et; <jats:italic>sec</jats:italic>\u2010Bu) and II (R = Et; <jats:italic>sec</jats:italic>\u2010Bu) with MAn was proportional to the square root of AIBN concentration, and intrinsic viscosity of poly\u2010I (R = Et)\u2010co\u2010MAn was proportional to the reciprocal square root of AIBN concentration.

The temperature was varied from \u221230 to \u221294\u00b0C., and the monomer/solvent ratio, the ratio of monomers, and the catalyst concentration were varied over a considerable range. The copolymerization equation was found to be applicable to the data, and the reactivity ratios were determined for various experimental conditions. For an \u201copen\u201d system in which the volume steadily increases during the course of polymerization, it is shown that the copolymerization equation is formally identical to that of Mayo and Lewis, except that concentrations are replaced by amounts of the reacting species. The temperature coefficients of the reactivity ratios in the present system are compared with those for free\u2010radical systems; some important differences are noted. The reactivity ratios of isobutylene and styrene in the present system are greatly increased under conditions of turbulent agitation. A procedure for the compositional fractionation of the copolymers is described. The results are interpreted in terms of the copolymer chain structure; they appear to admit the postulate that the reactivity ratios and corresponding propagation rate constants are functions of chain length.</jats:p>",

This suggests that VHQ behaves like styrene rather than as an inhibitor in the TBB\u2010initiated copolymerization. No homopolymerization was observed either under nitrogen or in the presence of oxygen. The reaction mechanism is discussed.</jats:p>",

Reactions exhibiting high monomers conversions were successfully performed, leading to the formation of very stable polymer lattices, whose average particle size is kept unchanged for relatively high storage times. The average molar masses determined by gel permeation chromatography showed to be very dependent on the amount of AMO in the reaction medium, presenting experimental values within the range from 280\u2009000 to 39\u2009000\u2009g\u2009mol<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> with molar mass dispersity ranging from 4 to 2 when the AMO fraction in the reaction medium was increased to 40\u2009wt%. The nucleation rate was affected by AMO in such way that an increase in AMO concentration must be accompanied by an increase in initiator concentration, which leads to the reduction of the average molar masses of the copolymer. The thermal analyses of the polymer materials showed that the glass transition temperature decreased with increasing amount of AMO in the copolymer chains.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Practical applications:</jats:bold> The use of vegetable oils and their derivatives as precursor monomers in polymerization reactions has increased each day due to their renewable origin.

The transport properties of this series of SPAEK copolymers were compared to poly(aryl ether ether ketone)s (SPEEK), poly(aryl ether ether ketone ketone)s (SPEEKK), and Nafion\u00ae membranes. It was found that the transport properties (including proton conductivity and methanol permeability) follows the trend of SPEEKK\u201060 &lt; SPAEK\u201060 &lt; SPEEK\u201060 &lt; Nafion\u00ae 117, the order of which is also attributed to the differences in the chemical structure of the polymers and the membrane morphology. In general, this novel series of SPAEK membranes possess various advantages, such as low cost of the initial monomers, high thermal and mechanical stability, and low methanol permeability while simultaneously possessing sufficient proton conductivity, which makes them notably promising as proton exchange membrane (PEM) materials in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this article the sensitivity of model predictions of composition drift toward deviations of 10% in all model parameters (maximum swellabilities of monomer in the polymer phase, water solubilities, reactivity ratios, and monomer and polymer densities) was estimated using the monomer combination methyl methacrylate\u2010styrene as an example. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded that the reactivity ratios are the most important parameters affecting composition drift. The effects of deviations in maximum swellabilities and monomer and polymer densities on composition drift can be neglected, while the water solubility is important only in those cases where the amount of monomer in the aqueous phase cannot be neglected as compared with the total monomer amount. \u00a9 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

The reactivity ratios calculated from the composition data indicate that the propagation rate constants favor addition of trifluoropropylene by a factor of 3\u20137; individual values depended little on the polymerization pressure and temperature. Polymerization rates changed little with monomer composition between 0 and 75% tetrafluoroethylene; between 75 and 95% tetrafluoroethylene they increased by a factor of 10. As many as 850,000 molecules were polymerized per 100 e.v. absorbed. The copolymers are soluble in hexafluorobenzene at 29.6\u00b0C. if they contain less than 70% tetrafluoroethylene. Intrinsic viscosities range from 0.1 to about 10 dl./g. From various considerations it appears likely that the degree of polymerization is about equal to the kinetic chain length in high\u2010pressure polymerizations at 21\u00b0C.; at autogenous pressure or at 5000 atm and 100\u00b0C., monomer transfer reduces the value considerably.</jats:p>",

A transition between an interpenetrating network structure for microgels with a pure poly-N,-n-propylacrylamide (PNNPAM) shell and a distinct core-shell morphology for microgels with a pure poly-N-isopropylmethacrylamide (PNIPMAM) shell is observable. The PNIPMAM molfraction of the shell also has an important influence on the particle rigidity because of the decreasing degree of interpenetration. Furthermore, the swelling behavior of the microgels is tunable by adjustment of the pH-value between a single-step volume phase transition and a linear swelling region at temperatures corresponding to the copolymer ratios of the shell. This flexibility makes the multiresponsive copolymer microgels interesting candidates for many applications, e.g., as membrane material with tunable permeability.</jats:p>",

It implies N\u2010acylation of the unsubstituted lactam by the polymer of the N\u2010acylated one, followed by the incorporation of the activated monomer and subsequent deacylation of the incorporated monomer unit.</jats:p>",

The POSS comonomer was efficiently incorporated into the polymer chain at up to 0.2 mol %. The differences in the copolymer compositions as the functions of the catalyst kind and the POSS comonomer were observed, including the varied number\u2010average sequence length of ethylene and unsaturated end groups, as determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR and FT\u2010IR. The presence of POSS comonomers affected also the melting and crystallization behavior of the copolymers, as evidenced by DSC, because of influence on the polymer chain arrangement.

On one hand, after the addition of a radical on the alkene, CKAs can undergo ring\u2010opening via radical rearrangement, enabling polyester preparation based on chain\u2010growth polymerization. On the other hand, the alkene connected with two electron\u2010donating oxygens in a strained form exhibit unique reactivities, resulting in complex reactions in the presence of electron deficient compounds. In this investigation, fundamental studies on CKA radical ring\u2010opening polymerization and charge\u2010mediated reactions were performed. Alternating copolymers of CKA and maleimides, or maleates, were prepared and characterized. Quantum chemistry modeling from the perspectives of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics enabled an in\u2010depth mechanistic study on the side reactions between CKA and maleic anhydride or itaconic anhydride, inspiring the techniques to minimize those side reactions in competition with radical copolymerization. After purifying the anhydride monomers with sublimation, the copolymerization with CKA successfully occurred. The anhydride containing polyester structures with an alternating sequence were confirmed with comprehensive characterizations. Facile post\u2010functionalization with an alcohol was performed, resulting in carboxylate containing polyesters.</jats:p>",

In this work, a polyethylene hollow\u2010fiber membrane was modified by this technique. The monomers glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and <jats:italic>N,N\u2010</jats:italic>dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) were cografted onto macroporous polyethylene hollow fiber with a grafting degree in the order of 200%. DMAA/GMA cografted membranes were compared to GMA grafted ones for the introduction of an amino acid as a specific ligand. Grafted membranes with a copolymer composition between 0 and 2 DMAA/GMA were prepared by soaking them in solutions of different mixtures of monomers. Copolymers were characterized by FTIR and their composition was estimated by the analysis of the ratio of carbonyl signals. Copolymers with a higher proportion of DMAA showed improved hydrophilic properties and higher conversion rates of epoxy groups on phenyalanine ligands than those of the GMA grafted ones. However, copolymers with a DMAA/GMA ratio higher than 1 showed a detrimental effect on the pure water flux. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 87: 1646\u20131653, 2003</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In the course of research into carbon-chain polymerization under the influence of the acid-type catalysts, aluminum chloride, boron fluoride, stannic chloride, and others, a series of investigations have established the fundamental mechanisms of these chain processes, indicating that they have an ionic character. On the basis of this research, it was suggested that the active center in carbon-chain polymerization is a compound with a tervalent positive carbon atom at the end. The kinetics of catalytic copolymerization had not been studied until the present. There has been only a little work published in connection with determining the composition of copolymers and calculating the copolymerization constants for the systems in question. We initiated some research into the dependence of the speed of catalytic copolymerization on the composition of the original mixture, in conjunction with a determination of the speeds of separate polymerization of the monomers involved, since a comparison of data on the kinetics of copolymerization with that of separate polymerization gives a more complete representation of the mechanism of the process. A study was made of the speed of copolymerization of the systems : isoprene-butadiene and styrene-butadiene, and also of the kinetics of separate polymerization of these monomers. Polymerization was carried out in ethyl chloride with stannic chloride as the catalyst, at 0\u00b0 C, by the dilatometric method.</jats:p>",

The radical copolymerizations of styrene with 5,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP) was conducted using 1\u2010phenyl\u20101\u2010(2,2,6,6\u2010tetramethyl\u20101\u2010piperidinyloxy)ethane as an initiator. The refractive index (RI) traces for the size\u2010exclusion chromatography of the resulting copolymers were unimodal with narrow molecular weight distributions. The RI traces shifted toward higher molecular weight regions as the polymerization progressed, and the number\u2010average molecular weights were close to those calculated on the basis of the feed compositions and monomer conversions. These features were in good agreement with a TEMPO\u2010mediated mechanism. The traces recorded by the ultraviolet\u2010visible (UV\u2010vis) detector (430 nm) were identical to those obtained by the RI detector, indicating a statistical copolymerization of styrene with H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP. This also indicated that H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP acted as a monomer and not as a terminator or a chain\u2010transfer agent under the conditions used. A benzyl radical addition to H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>TFPP was conducted as a model reaction for the copolymerization using tributyltin hydride as a chain\u2010transfer agent, affording a reduced porphyrin, 2\u2010benzyl\u20105,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)chlorin <jats:bold>1</jats:bold>, via radical addition to the \u03b2\u2010pyrrole position.

In the present paper the influence of different polyethers on the copolymerization of trioxane with dioxolane was studied. Several observations suggest the formation of block copolymer, mainly on the surface of particles of the precipitated copolymer. Particles are much smaller (diameters 8\u201312\u03bc) than those of copolymers prepared in the absence of polyethers (25\u2013100 \u03bc). The overall reactivities of comonomers are also changed; the relative reactivity of trioxane \u2013 which is less basic and less reactive in copolymerization \u2013 increases almost twice. As a tentative explanation the participation of the basic polyether in the solvation shell of the ion pair is proposed. Due to the increase in reactivity of trioxane the composition of copolymer prepared in the presence of polyether is more uniform, and the content of the unstable fraction is lower.</jats:p><jats:p>These two primary effects are responsible for several consequences: Since the smaller particles have the same specific surface (ca. 25 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g), the surface of these particles is smoother. The reaction mixture, containing as much as 60 wt.\u2010% of solid copolymer, is fluid. A monomolecular layer of polyether (partially in the form of blocks, partially adsorbed) on the polyacetal particle surface seems to be sufficient to cause the observed phenomena. This outer polyether skin prevents the agglomeration of polyacetal particles.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Confidence contours in parameter space are a helpful tool to compare and classify determined estimators. For more intricate parameter estimations of non-linear nature or complex error structures, the procedure of determining confidence contours is a statistically complex task. For polymer chemists, such particular cases are encountered in determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization. Hereby, determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization requires non-linear parameter estimation. Additionally, data may possess (possibly correlated) errors in both dependent and independent variables. A common approach for such non-linear estimations is the error-in-variables model yielding statistically unbiased estimators. Regarding reactivity ratios, to date published procedures neglect the non-Gaussian structure of the error estimates which is a consequence of the non-linearity of the model. In this publication, this issue is addressed by employing a Bayesian hierarchical model, which correctly propagates the errors of all variables. We detail the statistical procedure in chemist friendly language to encourage confident usage of our tool. Our approach is based on a \\texttt{Python} program requiring minimal installation effort. A detailed manual of the code is included in the appendix of this work, in an effort to make this procedure available to all interested polymer chemists.</jats:p>",

Melting points and glass transition temperatures studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry show a decrease with rising comonomer content and increasing length of the \u03b1\u2010olefin.</jats:p>",

The effect of the grinding of quartz on the copolymerization was investigated by characterizing both the polymer formed and the ground quartz. The copolymerization proceeds apparently from the quartz grindings and was closely related to the total surface area of the ground quartz. The molecular weight distributions of the copolymers formed were unimodal as found in a homopolymer of only methyl methacrylate. It was clear from the composition analysis of the copolymer that the mechanochemical copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and styrene proceeded with a radical polymerization mechanism because of radicals on the quartz surface produced by the grinding. The monomer reactivity ratios obtained by the Fineman\u2010Ross method suggested that the copolymers formed were alternating copolymers. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It was found that, when hydroperoxides were used as cocatalysts, triethylboron and tri-rc-butylboron were active as catalysts, while triphenylboron was inactive. As cocatalysts,, hydroperoxides were more active than disubstituted peroxides. The highest catalytic activity was observed when the cocatalyst/catalyst molar ratio was 0.4. The initiating radical has been suggested to be the hydroxy radical, and the initiating mechanism has been discussed briefly. The yield and the reduced specific viscosity of the copolymer decrease rapidly with an increase in the ethylene content of the monomer mixture. The monomer reactivity ratios were: r1(vinyl chloride) = 4.16 and r2(ethylene) = 0.05. This indicates that the copolymerization reaction proceeds via a normal radical mechanism.

The stepwise copolymerization of the AB<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and AB monomers was also carried out, and the structure was analyzed by <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C NMR measurements. Copolymer synthesized stepwise by adding AB<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> monomer first (polymer <jats:bold>II</jats:bold>) had more dendritic units and less terminal units as compared with the one\u2010step copolymer (polymer <jats:bold>I</jats:bold>). Copolymer synthesized stepwise by adding AB monomer first gave a resulting copolymer (polymer <jats:bold>III</jats:bold>) composed of long AB chains. The solubility of the stepwise copolymers was low, and the inherent viscosity was high in comparison with the one\u2010step copolymer as a result of the difference in architecture of the copolymers. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Up to now catalytic copolymerization with alkali catalysts has hardly been studied. Only a few papers have been published which give quantitative data. Judging by the values of the copolymerization constants, monomers differ very considerably in their reactivities. Monomers in which the double bond of the vinyl group is conjugated with the multiple bond of a nitrile or a carboxyl group have the greatest activity. The copolymerization of diene hydrocarbons under the action of basic catalysts has not been investigated as yet. It is known that in free radical (emulsion) polymerization these hydrocarbons have relatively similar activities. It seemed interesting to establish the relative reactivity of the diene hydrocarbons, isoprene and 1,3-butadiene, which differ by only a methyl group, in alkali-catalyzed copolymerization. Labeled atoms were used for determining the composition of the copolymers. For this we synthesized isoprene containing radioactive carbon, C14 (from acetylene-C14, prepared from BaC14O3) by a modification of Favorskii\u02d8's method. Copolymerization and separate polymerizations of isoprene and 1,3-butadiene were carried out in hexane solution with butyllithium at 50\u00b0, with a total monomer concentration of 2 moles/liter and a catalyst concentration of 0.0025 mole/liter. Butyllithium was synthesized by the known method. The butyllithium solution was analyzed by the usual method with a double titration. Thoroughly purified and dried monomers and solvent were used for the polymerization. All operations of measuring out the products into the reaction ampules were carried out in a current of dry nitrogen and in a vacuum apparatus having a distributing comb (manifold). The reaction ampules consisted of two sections, separated by a wall and connected with a graduate tube. The solvent and monomers were placed in one section and the catalyst, a solution of butyllithium in hexane, in the other.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An examination of the usual terminal and penultimate mechanisms of copolymerization shows that, for a great many comonomer pairs, copolymer composition data are not sufficient to choose one model over the other. The reactivity ratios based on one copolymerization model can be derived from the reactivity ratios of the other model. Predicted copolymer composition, based on both models, will agree with the observed experimental data within the precision of the usual methods used for copolymer analysis. Hypothetical cases and examples from the literature all show this behavior. The literature comonomer systems were \u03b1\u2010methylstyrene\u2013acrylonitrile, and styrene with maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, and acrylonitrile. Polymer structure, however, predicted by the two mechanisms do differ appreciably in detail. In particular, predictions of the sequential arrangements of the monomers in the copolymers produced are different for the terminal and penultimate mechanisms. It would seem that the development of experimental procedures for determining the sequential arrangement of the comonomers will be necessary before one can easily and definitely distinguish between terminal and penultimate copolymerization models for a particular system.</jats:p>",

The supported catalyst copolymerized more comonomer into the polymer chain than the homogeneous catalyst at the same monomer feed ratio. Data of reactivity ratios showed that the depression in the activity of propylene instead of an enhancement in the activity of olefinic comonomer was responsible for this phenomenon. We also found that copolymerization with \u03b1\u2010olefins and supporting the metallocene on a carrier improved the stereoregularity and regioregularity of the copolymers. The melting temperature of all the copolymers decreased linearly with growing comonomer content, regardless of the comonomer type and catalyst system.

Vacuum\u2010dried residual copolymer products (RCP) were analyzed by gel\u2010permeation chromatography (GPC), vapor\u2010pressure osmometry (VPO) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR). Attempts to homopolymerize THF in equimolar mixtures of DCE and THF at THF/TPMHFP ratios of 1:1 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22123</jats:sup> proved futile, while the homopolymerization of PO under identical operating conditions took place quite readily. Copolymerizations of PO\u2013THF mixtures were easily carried out with high and often complete consumption of both monomers though, more often than not, THF was the principal residual monomer at the end of the 24 hr reaction period since, under no circumstances could additional THF be polymerized when the PO charged was completely consumed. Linearity of plots of \u2212ln (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>/<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>) versus time showed the reactions to be first order with respect to both PO and THF concentrations. Influence of temperature reveals, via Arrhenius plots and overall activation energies (16.0 kcal/mole for PO and 13.0 kcal/mole for THF), that the initiator system functions similarly to other reported systems. Reactivity ratios (0.26 for PO and 0.80 for THF) indicate that monomer units tend to alternate along the chains rather than form extended segments of a given kind. This is supported by NMR analyses of RCP samples. Bimodal GPC distributions observed in the present study suggest that the copolymerization reaction may be proceeding by either a dual mechanism or a two\u2010step process.</jats:p>",

The kinetically determined microstructure (gradient, alternate, etc.) observed in the first stage of copolymerization is related to reactivity ratios. It evolves into the equilibrium microstructure, determined exclusively by the equilibrium constants and initial conditions.

Isolated (meth)acrylate units are proposed to be sandwiched between DBF units. The ratios of \u03c0-stacked and unstacked side-chain fluorene groups of DBF units in excited states were accurately determined on the basis of fluorescent emission spectra; DBF units are mostly \u03c0-stacked in excited states as disclosed by fluorescence spectra.

The cyclics investigated were hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, hexaphenylcyclotrisiloxane, and all six members of the series,  where R is methyl and/or phenyl. The products of the reactivity ratios for a number of the monomer pairs studied were close to unity, thus indicating little catalyst specificity. Polymerization reactivity increased with increased ring strain and increased degree of phenyl substitution. The tetraphenyl silethylene\u2010siloxane cyclic, the most reactive cyclic to base\u2010catalyzed polymerization, was found to be about one hundred and sixty times more reactive than the least reactive cyclic, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane. Reactivity ratios were found to be quite temperature\u2010dependent, thus suggesting rather large differences in activation energy. With increasing temperature, the reactivity ratios approached a value of unity.</jats:p>",

The approach used was to measure the rate of formation of disappearance of the styryl anion spectrophotometrically, using the absorption peak at 436 m\u03bc. The solutions of butadienyl and styryl anions (in benzene) were prepared by reacting butyllithium with small amounts of butadiene or styrene, in a preliminary step, until the initiation reaction was complete. Subsequently, each of the anionic solutions was mixed with the opposite monomer, and the cross\u2010propagation reaction measured spectrophotometrically. It was found that the rate of the reaction of the styryl anion with butadiene was <jats:italic>extremely rapid</jats:italic>, being virtually completed in less than one minute at room temperature. On the other hand, the rate of reaction of the butadienyl anions with styrene was easily measurable at room temperature, being of the same order as the previously measured homopolymerization rates for butadiene. These measurements enabled a calculation of the following reactivity ratios: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>B</jats:sub> = 3, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>S</jats:sub> = .06.

We studied the effect of the use of different polyurethane seed particles and the effect of different weight ratios of methyl methacrylate to butyl acrylate on the emulsion properties, microphase structure, and mechanical properties of hybrid films. The average particle size and distribution were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. The rheological properties of polyurethane dispersions and hybrid emulsions were tested under destructive conditions by an examination of flow curves and under nondestructive conditions of oscillatory shear in a range of linear viscoelastic responses. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed to characterize the thermal\u2010response properties of polymeric films. The relative average molecular weights were determined by gel permeation chromatography. The interactions between the acrylic and polyurethane components in hybrid particles and particle structure were studied with infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

The structure and degree of sulfonation (DS) of the SPAEKs were characterized using <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy. The experimentally observed DS values were close to the expected values derived from the starting material ratios. The thermal stabilities of the SPAEKs were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, which showed that in acid and sodium salt forms they were thermally stable in air up to about 240 and 380 \u00b0C, respectively. Transparent membranes cast from the directly polymerized SPAEKs exhibited good mechanical properties in both dry and hydrated states. The dependence of water uptake and of membrane swelling on the DS at different temperatures was studied. SPAEK membranes with a DS from 0.72 to 1.60 maintained adequate mechanical properties after immersion in water at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. The proton conductivity of SPAEK membranes with different degrees of sulfonation was measured as a function of temperature. The proton conductivity of the SPAEK films increased with increased DS, and the highest room temperature conductivity (4.2 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup> S/cm) was recorded for a SPAEK membrane with a DS of 1.60, which further increased to 1.1 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> S/cm at 80 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The PPEK copolymers exhibited high glass transition temperatures, excellent thermooxidative properties, good mechanical properties and improved solubility, all of which can be tailored by changing the molar ratio of phthalazinone to bisphenol monomers. The rheological investigation indicated that the incorporation of the flexible BPA moiety into the main chain lowered the melt viscosity of the copolymers. To improve the melt processability further, polymer blends of a PPEK copolymer/polycarbonate (PC) were prepared. The results suggested that blending is an effective approach for improving the melt processability of phthalazinone\u2010containing PAEs. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of crosslink density, type and concentration of initiator, the use of a complex initiator system, porogen, and diluent on the most relevant parameters of FP, such as sustainability of the front, temperature profile, front velocity, and yield. The products were also characterized for intruded pore volume, pore\u2010size distribution, epoxy\u2010functionality number, and surface morphology. Higher crosslink densities (CLDs) and initiator concentration produced higher front velocities, whereas no trend in front temperature was noted. A complex initiation system was effective in stabilizing and increasing the polymerization yield. Relative to suspension polymerization (SP), FP products synthesized without a solvent were microporous, whereas micro\u2010to\u2010macroporous products were obtained in the presence of a solvent (for HEMA\u2013EGDM polymers). We also present, explain, and discuss the exotic patterns observed under a microscope. We observed two basic types of spatial patterns, namely, planar and nonplanar patterns. The type of planar pattern observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has a spatial impulse that appears as a loop followed by regular periodic motion in the radial and axial directions. This behavior gives rise to a repeating pattern that is a few microns thick. Also, nonplanar patterns, namely, layered concentric rings and winding staircase patterns, were observed under SEM.</jats:p>",

The systems in which Manh or DMM was used as an acceptor monomer gave the alternating copolymers at various monomer to feed ratios. The terpolymerizaton of the I\u2013Manh\u2013DMM system established that DMM takes little part in giving the alternating copolymers I and Manh. Consequently, it was assumed that the reactivity of the CT complex monomer is dependent on the contribution of the dative structure to CT complex.</jats:p>",

The results indicated that both the conversion and molecular weight of polymerization reduce gradually when the MLA content is increased in the feed and that bifunctional comonomer MLA possesses a larger reactivity ratio than acrylonitrile (AN). P (AN-co-MLA) shows improved stabilization compared to the PAN homopolymer and poly (acrylonitrile-acrylic acid-methacrylic acid) [P (AN-AA-MA)], showing features such as lower initiation temperature, smaller cyclic activation energy, wider exothermic peak, and a larger stabilization degree, which are due to the ionic cyclization reaction initiated by MLA, confirming that the as-prepared P (AN-co-MLA) is the potential precursor for high-performance carbon fiber.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>After a brief review of the characteristics of the copolymerization of donor and acceptor monomers in the presence of metal halides, a mechanism is proposed for the formation of alternating copolymers. The charge\u2010transfer donor\u2010acceptor complex resulting from the interaction of a strong electron\u2010acceptor monomer and a strong electron\u2010donor monomer undergoes spontaneous or radical initiated homopolymerization to yield an equimolar alternating copolymer, irrespective of the initial monomer ratio. The formation of the [D<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-1.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:04492994:media:POLC5070310122:tex2gif-stack-1\" />A] complex is enhanced by complexation of the acceptor monomer with a metal halide or organometal halide. The homopolymerization of the (D<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/tex2gif-stack-2.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:04492994:media:POLC5070310122:tex2gif-stack-2\" />A\u2026 [MX] occurs at a faster rate than conventional radical copolymerization. The spontaneous polymerization occurs when the equilibrium concentration of the complex is sufficiently high. The latter depends upon the electron\u2010donating strength of the donor monomer and the electron\u2010accepting strength of the acceptor monomer and the activator. Complex formation is favored at lower temperatures while polymerization may require thermal or catalytic activation. The complexes may be aligned in an ordered array or matrix, and polymerization proceeds through a rapid initial stage in which the molecular weight increases with conversion, followed by a slower stage in which the molecular weight remains constant at the highest level attained in the first stage, indicative of the first\u2010stage polymer acting as a template for the second\u2010stage polymerization. The proposed polymerization mechanism involves initiation by a head\u2010to\u2010head reaction of two complexes during which hydrogen abstraction or transfer occurs through a six\u2010membered cyclic transition state to generate a polymer chain with an attached terminal complex. The propagation reaction is head\u2010to\u2010tail and involves the addition of complexes to the chain end through hydrogen abstraction via a six\u2010membered cyclic transition state to regenerate the complex chain end.</jats:p>",

(2) Increasing the feed ratio [GPE]<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>/[1]<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> to larger than 4 allowed almost all of the lactone moieties to participate in the copolymerization system to give the corresponding networked polymers efficiently.

By proper selection of the catalytic system and the reaction conditions, a variety of copolymers with different compositions, structures, and properties can be obtained. Thus, copolymers containing a very low amount of styrene (or p-methylstyrene) on a substantially polyethylenic backbone are crystalline thermoplastics, which could be used to produce functionalized PEs. Increasing the styrene content leads to a rapid decrease in the crystallinity, affording materials which show good thermoelastomeric properties. Copolymers containing around 20 mol % styrene are effective compatibilizers for polyethylene\u2014polystyrene blends. The molecular structure of these copolymers has been defined being \u201cpseudorandom,\u201d since EEE, EES, ESE, and SES sequences are observed, and no SS sequences are present, thus the styrene content cannot exceed 50 mol %. Very recently, however, a random copolymer containing SS sequences in a stereoregular arrangement has been reported. Also, truly alternating E-S copolymers have been obtained with suitable catalysts. These poly(ethylene-alt-styrenes) can be either atactic (and thus amorphous) or stereoregular, depending on the particular catalyst used. Interestingly, isotactic poly(ethylene-alt-styrene) is a new crystalline material with a melting point of 145 \u00b0C, whose crystal structure has recently been determined. In conclusion, further research on ethylene\u2014styrene copolymerization promises to afford a variety of new interesting materials starting from two widespread, easily available and inexpensive monomers.</jats:p>",

The final product consists of a homopolymer nucleus surrounded by concentric shells of copolymers with different composition; the initial composition is quite rich in the monomer that forms the nucleus while the process ends with an enriched layer of the second homopolymer. Since the middle copolymer layer tends to increase the compatibility among the original homopolyers, we expected to have a set of core\u2010shell products with completely different properties. However, the experimental results showed that this was not the case. The composition effect on the viscoelastic properties shows, on one hand, that an increase in the butyl acrylate content lowers the elastic response of the final product, and on the other hand, that the elasticity increases with copolymer content. As the initiator content in the reaction media increases, the viscosity of the coreshell products decreases because of the existence of a media flooded with free radicals. If the butyl acrylate is first added, a graft polymerization is favored because of the polar nature of this homopolymer and, therefore, the molecular weight level increases.</jats:p>",

Being swollen, these amorphous chain segments become sufficiently mobile to contribute to the SSP process. The thermal behavior of the resulting copolyesters is comparable with melt copolymerized copolymers, although having a different chemical microstructure. The main reason is a full miscibility in the melt of unmodified PBT chain segments and modified chain segments, which eliminates the advantages of a blocky microstructure for the SSP copolyesters. However, incorporation of 2,2\u2032\u2010biphenyldimethanol (BDM) into PBT resulted in a higher crystallization temperature compared with PBT\u2013Dianol copolymers of equal composition. Preordering of polymer chains in the melt by incorporating rigid, phase separating BDM\u2010moieties, preferably via SSP to obtain a non\u2010random distribution, may be the origin of the enhanced crystallization temperature. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Polyesters (PEs) are sustainable alternatives for conventional polymers owing to their potential degradability, recyclability, and the wide availability of bio-based monomers for their synthesis. Herein, we used a one-pot, one-step self-switchable polymerization linking the ring-opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of epoxides/cyclic anhydrides with the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide (LLA) to synthesize PE-based hot-melt adhesives with a high bio-based content. In the cesium pivalate-catalyzed self-switchable polymerization of glutaric anhydride (GA), butylene oxide (BO), and LLA using a diol initiator, the ROAC of GA and BO proceeded whereas the ROP of LLA simultaneously proceeded very slowly, resulting in a copolyester consisting of poly(GA-alt-BO) and poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) segments with tapered regions, that is, PLLA-tapered block-poly(GA-alt-BO)-tapered block-PLLA (PLLA-tb-poly(GA-alt-BO)-tb-PLLA). Additionally, a series of tapered-block or real-block copolyesters consisting of poly(anhydride-alt-epoxide) (A segment) and PLLA (B segment) with AB-, BAB-, (AB)3-, and (AB)4-type architectures of different compositions and molecular weights were synthesized by varying the monomer combinations, alcohol initiators, and initial feed ratios. The lap shear tests of these copolyesters revealed an excellent relationship between the adhesive strength and polymer structural parameters. The (AB)4-type star-block copolyester (poly(GA-alt-BO)-tb-PLLA)4 exhibited the best adhesive strength (6.74 \u00b1 0.64 MPa), comparable to that of commercial products, such as PE-based and poly(vinyl acetate)-based hot-melt adhesives.</jats:p>",

The effect of these catalysts on catalytic behavior, namely activity, molecular weight and monomer reactivity ratios, has been investigated. The results showed that all of them acted by a single site polymerization mechanism and the molecular weight distribution is independent of catalyst structure. Based on the study, it revealed that the introduction of a t-butyl at the 2,7 position on the fluorenyl ligand is able to enhance both catalytic activity and copolymer molecular weight more than introducing a cyclododecyl on the amine, which is probably associated with the electronic effect exerted by the t-butyl substituent. The comonomer incorporation content was controllable over a wide range by adjusting the comonomer feed ratio. Moreover, referring to monomer reactivity ratio exploration, it seems that the substitution on the ansa-fluorenylamidodimethyltitanium complex tends to hinder the insertion of 1-hexene into the polymer chain, leading to the highest 1-hexene content for traditional complex 1.</jats:p>",

Even at 1:5 lLA/\u03b5CL ratio Mg complex 1 catalyzed homopolymerization of lLA without involving \u03b5CL to the formation of the polymer backbone. On the contrary, Zn complex 3 efficiently catalyzed random lLA/\u03b5CL copolymerization; the presence of mono-lactate subunits in the copolymer chain clearly pointed to the transesterification mechanism of copolymer formation. Both epimerization and transesterification side processes were analyzed using the density functional theory (DFT) modeling that confirmed the qualitative difference in catalytic behavior of 1 and 3: Mg and Zn complexes demonstrated different types of preferable coordination on the PLA chain (k2 and k3, respectively) with the result that complex 3 catalyzed controlled \u03b5CL ROP/PLA transesterification, providing the formation of lLA/\u03b5CL copolymers that contain mono-lactate fragments separated by short oligo(\u03b5CL) chains. The best results in the synthesis of random lLA/\u03b5CL copolymers were obtained during experiments on transesterification of commercially available PLLA, the applicability of 3/BnOH catalyst in the synthesis of random copolymers of \u03b5CL with methyl glycolide, ethyl ethylene phosphonate and ethyl ethylene phosphate was also demonstrated.</jats:p>",

In the copolymerization of St and DPE\u2010SiH, when DPE\u2010SiH was excessively fed, a strictly alternating structure can be prepared. As the feed ratios of S/D increased, a gradient structure was obtained. Additionally, when the substituent structure of the DPE derivatives changed, the sequence structure could be regulated. It has been confirmed in the copolymerization of St and DPE\u2010SiH/OMe or DPE\u2010SiH/NMe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, that the electron\u2010donating group (\u2010OMe or \u2010NMe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) was introduced into DPE\u2010SiH.

Two initiation and two termination rates are assumed, one for each monomer. Four propagation rates are considered, corresponding to the four possibilities of addition, namely, addition of monomer A to a chain ending in A* or to a chain ending in B* and addition of monomer B to a chain ending in A* or to a chain ending in B*. Over-all rate and number average molecular weight are calculated. The composition of the polymer and the number distribution curves of groups of submolecules a and of submolecules b are calculated as functions of the monomer composition and two rate constant ratios. These last results are of general character and independent of the nature of the initiation and termination processes provided that the average degree of polymerization is ``high.''</jats:p>",

The flotation experiment showed that both copolymers had an oil removal of 97% at the concentration of 30\u2009mg/L.

The activation energy of DMAPMA\u2010C<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>DM copolymerization (89.64\u2009kJ/mol) was smaller than that of DMAPMA\u2010C<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>MVBA (91.65\u2009kJ/mol) copolymerization.

The Zn and Cd salts are fairly soluble in most organic solvents. Therefore, the Zn salt and Cd salt were selected for the copolymerization with MMA, styrene (St), and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). In the copolymerization, the rates of copolymerization increased markedly as the concentration of metal salts increased. Moreover, the systems containing MMA copolymerized more rapidly than those containing St. As for the physical properties of the copolymers obtained, compressive strength and Rockwell hardness were improved by introducing metal salts into the polymers; and heat distortion temperature and tensile and flexural strengths were also improved by selecting the most suitable concentration of metal salts according to the species of metal salts and vinyl monomers. The TGA and the boiling water resistance of the copolymers were also discussed.</jats:p>",

For the first time, the effect of hydrogen bonding on the classical alternating-type copolymerization of styrene and maleimide was explored. N-phenylmaleimide (N-PMI)/styrene was chosen as a model monomer pair in the presence of hydrogen bonding donor solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), which interacted with N-PMI via hydrogen bonding. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) technique was used to guarantee the \u201cliving\u201d polymerization and thus the homogeneity of chain compositions. In comparison with the polymerization in nonhydrogen bonding donor solvent (toluene), the copolymerization in HFIP exhibited a high rate and a slight deviation from alternating copolymerization tendency. The reactivity ratios of N-PMI and St were revealed to be 0.078 and 0.068, respectively, while the reactivity ratios in toluene were 0.026 and 0.050. These interesting results were reasonably explained by using computer simulations, wherein the steric repulsion and electron induction by the hydrogen bonding between HFIP and NPMI were revealed. This work first elucidated the hydrogen bonding interaction in the classical alternating-type copolymerization, which will enrich the research on hydrogen bonding-induced polymerizations.</jats:p>",

To ensure the uniform composition of the resulting copolymers (telechelic oligodiols), the copolymerization was conducted with incremental feeding of the EO comonomer, which was more reactive in the cationic process. <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR analysis of samples isolated at different stages of the copolymerization indicated that the average composition of the copolymer was indeed nearly constant over the course of the copolymerization. Matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization time\u2010of\u2010flight spectra of the products revealed, however, that for the same degree of polymerization, macromolecules containing different numbers of EO units were present. The observed distribution was compared with the distribution simulated under the assumption that the probability of incorporating a given unit depended only on the feed composition (nearly constant during the copolymerization). With this assumption, a good agreement between the observed and simulated spectra was obtained. This indicated that, even when the optimum conditions for the formation of a uniform copolymer were created, the individual macromolecules differed in composition because of the statistical character of the copolymerization. The results of differential scanning calorimetry analysis were compatible with such a conclusion; two melting peaks appeared on differential scanning calorimetry curves when a sample was heated immediately after fast cooling, and this may indicate the presence of different types of crystallites. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Under the different combination of the catalysts and the comonomers, the microstructure of copolymer changes from ideal random to rich successive comonomer segment, although the two comonomers are very similar in the structure. Allylcyclohexane prefers to form the copolymer with the feature of rich successive comonomer segment, and the more random structure could be observed in the copolymer of allylcyclopentane.

Heat treatment or the orientation induces a parallel alignment of the molecular rods in the amorphous phase, similar to the cyrstalline structure of PAN.

It has been established that keto-enol tautomerism is the only reaction realized in the vinylcyclohexylketone molecules having mobile hydrogen atom at a -position in the cyclohexane ring, enol form of which is formed by charge-transfer complexes with anhydride or imide of maleic acid as acceptor monomers.

Although their radical homopolymerizations were very slow, radical copolymerizations proceeded well with various common vinyl monomers, such as methyl acrylate (MA), acrylonitrile (AN), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and styrene (St), resulting in copolymers with comparable incorporation ratios of bio-based cyclic conjugated monomer units ranging from 40 to 60 mol% at a 1:1 feed ratio. The monomer reactivity ratios when using AN as a comonomer were close to 0, whereas those with St were approximately 0.5 to 1, indicating that these diene monomers can be considered electron-rich monomers. Reversible addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) copolymerizations with MA, AN, MMA, and St were all successful when using S-cumyl-S\u2019-butyl trithiocarbonate (CBTC) as the RAFT agent resulting in copolymers with controlled molecular weights. The copolymers obtained with AN, MMA, or St showed glass transition temperatures (Tg) similar to those of common vinyl polymers (Tg ~ 100 \u00b0C), indicating that biobased cyclic structures were successfully incorporated into commodity polymers without losing good thermal properties.</jats:p>",

More precisely, monomers such as CL and LA were copolymerized, in dilute solution, by the well\u2010known coordination\u2010insertion ring\u2010opening mechanism initiated directly from the clay platelets. This method is based on the use of MMT organo\u2010modified by ammonium cations bearing hydroxyl functions. Using a surfactant mixture that contains varying proportions of hydroxyl\u2010substituted alkyl ammonium and non\u2010functionalized alkylammonium cations for exchanging the initial Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> counterions of the natural clay allows preparing organoclays with a tunable amount of hydroxyl functions on their surface. These hydroxyl functions can then easily be derivatized into aluminium alkoxides in order to initiate the polymerization directly from the surface of clay swollen in an organic solvent like toluene. The resulting activated organo\u2010clays proved to promote efficiently the block copolymerization of CL and LA in solution. The results demonstrate that adjusting the parameters allows to control the process. Indeed, the growing copolyester chains are effectively surface\u2010anchored onto the clay and their average length and grafting density can readily be modulated by the available amount of OH functions on the MMT platelets. These new organic\u2010inorganic nanohybrid materials present nearly exfoliated morphologies and the grafted copolymers display a semi\u2010crystalline and blocky structure as attested by DSC and NMR analyses, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:boxed-text content-type=\"graphic\" position=\"anchor\"><jats:caption><jats:p>TEM photograph of the recovered nanohybrid based on poly[CL\u2010<jats:italic>block</jats:italic>\u2010LA] diblock copolyester grafted onto Cloisite\u00ae30B surface.</jats:p></jats:caption><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mimetype=\"image/jpeg\" position=\"anchor\" specific-use=\"enlarged-web-image\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mgra001.jpg\"><jats:alt-text>magnified image</jats:alt-text><jats:caption><jats:p>TEM photograph of the recovered nanohybrid based on poly[CL\u2010<jats:italic>block</jats:italic>\u2010LA] diblock copolyester grafted onto Cloisite\u00ae30B surface.</jats:p></jats:caption></jats:graphic></jats:boxed-text>\n</jats:p>",

Due to the heterogeneity of the polymerization system often combined with nonideal kinetics, predicting copolymer composition and changes in feed composition as a function of time is not straightforward. Therefore, accurate and fast on\u2010line determination of partial conversions of the separate monomers is a key to understanding and controlling the copolymer system studied. For this reason on\u2010line densimetry, resulting in overall weight conversion, is combined with on\u2010line gas chromatography, resulting in the overall ratios of the residual monomer. Combining these two on\u2010line data gives the partial conversion of each monomer as a function of time without the need of an internal standard. The determination of partial conversion of monomers in batch emulsion copolymerization from on\u2010line gas chromatography and on\u2010line densimetry is illustrated for the monomer system methyl acrylate\u2010vinyl acetate. \u00a9 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Monopotassium dipropylene glycoxide, activated by a 18-crown-6 cation complexing agent (K-DPG/L, where DPG (dipropylene glycol) is a mixture of isomers) was used as an effective initiator of the homopolymerization and copolymerization of several monosubstituted oxiranes, i.e., propylene oxide (PO), 1.2-butylene oxide (BO), and some glycidyl ethers such as allyl, isopropyl, phenyl, and benzyl ones (AGE, IPGE, PGE, and BGE, respectively). The copolymers are novel and can be prospectively used for the fabrication of new thermoplastic or crosslinked polyurethanes. All processes were carried out in homogeneous mild conditions, i.e., tetrahydrofuran solution at room temperature and normal pressure. They resulted in new unimodal macrodiols with Mn = Mcalc in the range of 1500\u20138300, low dispersity Mw/Mn = 1.08\u20131.18 and a chemical structure well defined by several techniques, i.e., MALDI-TOF, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), 13C NMR, and FTIR. Monopotassium salts of homopolyether-diols, i.e., PPO-diol, PBO-diol, and PAGE-diol, appeared to be useful macroinitiators for the preparation of new triblock copolyether-diols by polymerization of glycidyl ethers. In BO/BGE random copolymerization initiated with K-DPG/L, macromolecules of copolyether-diol were exclusively formed. Macromolecules of copolyether-diol accompanied by homopolyether PPO-diol were identified in the PO/PGE system. However, AGE and PGE reacted by giving random copolyether-diol as well as homopolymer-diols, i.e., PAGE-diol and PPGE-diol. Macromolecules of prepared copolyether-diols contain various numbers of mers deriving from comonomers; the kind of comonomer determines the composition of the product. Several prepared homopolyether-diols and copolyether-diols could be useful for the synthesis of new thermoplastic polyurethanes.</jats:p>",

A series of copolymers with varied comonomer incorporation, high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution were obtained at mild conditions. The effects of the insertion of the comonomers on the microstructure, thermal and final mechanical properties were systemically studied by 13C NMR, wide-angle X-ray scattering, DSC and tensile test. Excellent mechanical performances were achieved by tuning the incorporation and chain length of the higher \u03b1-olefins. When the comonomer content reached above 12 mol.%, polypropylene-based elastomers were obtained with high ductility. A combination of excellent elastic recovery and flexibility was achieved for the P/C16 copolymers with about 20 mol.% monomer incorporation. The monomer incorporation and side chain length played a crucial role in determining the mechanical property of the outstanding polypropylene-based elastomers.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>In emulsion copolymerizations, the two monomers might not be equally incorporated in the copolymers. Besides copolymerization in the particles, also copolymerization in the aqueous phase can take place which affects the formation of oligomeric radicals responsible for the entry of radicals into the particles. In describing copolymerization in emulsion polymerization, one can use the normal reactivity ratios in combination with the monomer feed ratios in the phase at hand (either water phase or particle phase). Most of the research works done were focused on the feed ratio of the monomers in the particle phase. This is because of the interest in the final product.  But in case of water\u2010soluble monomers, where significant amount of polymerization already occurs in the water phase, feed ratios of monomers in the water phase have to be known. Even for less water\u2010soluble monomers, the feed ratios in the aqueous phase are important to know, related to entry of radicals. Therefore, to calculate feed ratios in water phase, solubilities of mixtures of monomers in this phase have been measured by using a UV\u2010Vis technique. It is shown that the solubility of one monomer is influenced by the presence of another monomer.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The aim of this research was to study the effect of the initiator on the resulting monomer distribution for the cationic ring\u2010opening copolymerization of 2\u2010ethyl\u20102\u2010oxazoline (EtOx) and 2\u2010phenyl\u20102\u2010oxazoline (PhOx). At first, kinetic studies were performed for the homopolymerizations of both monomers at 160 \u00b0C under microwave irradiation using four initiators. These initiators have the same benzyl\u2010initiating group but different leaving groups, Cl<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>, Br<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>, I<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>, and OTs<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>. The basicity of the leaving group affects the ratio of covalent and cationic propagating species and, thus, the polymerization rate. The observed differences in polymerization rates could be correlated to the concentration of cationic species in the polymerization mixture as determined by <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>H NMR spectroscopy. In a next\u2010step, polymerization kinetics were determined for the copolymerizations of EtOx and PhOx with these four initiators. The reactivity ratios for these copolymerizations were calculated from the polymerization rates obtained for the copolymerizations. This approach allows more accurate determination of the copolymerization parameters compared to conventional methods using the composition of single polymers. When benzyl chloride (BCl) was used as an initiator, no copolymers could be obtained because its reactivity is too low for the polymerization of PhOx. With decreasing basicity of the used counterions (Br<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> &gt; I<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup> &gt; OTs<jats:sup>\u2212</jats:sup>), the reactivity ratios gradually changed from <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>EtOx</jats:sub> = 10.1 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>PhOx</jats:sub> = 0.30 to <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>EtOx</jats:sub> = 7.9 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>PhOx</jats:sub> = 0.18. However, the large difference in reactivity ratios will lead to the formation of quasi\u2010diblock copolymers in all cases. In conclusion, the used initiator does influence the monomer distribution in the copolymers, but for the investigated system the differences were so small that no difference in the resulting polymer properties is expected. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Transparent zero-birefringence copolymers were successfully synthesized by randomly copolymerizing   two monomers having positive and negative birefringence, respectively. Since the   anisotropic polarization of the negative birefringent monomer units is compensated by   the positive birefringent monomer units on the same polymer chain, the birefringence is   compensated on the length scale of only several monomer units and becomes zero for   any degree of orientation. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was used as the negative   birefringent monomer, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (3FMA) as the positive   birefringent monomer. Poly(MMA-co-3FMA) copolymer synthesized with a   composition of MMA/3FMA=45/55 (wt./wt.) showed no birefringence for any draw   ratio when a sample film was uniaxially heat-drawn to 3.5 times its original length.

To reduce redistribution reaction, the lithium\u2010based dianionic initiator (BDMOLiPE) was first used for the copolymerization of the cyclotetrasiloxane monomers without solvent, with dimethyl formamide (DMF) as a promotor. The cyclotetrasiloxanes used involved octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>), octaphenylcyclotetrasiloxane (P<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>), and tetramethyl\u2010tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>).

Copolymerizing kinetics and different monomer ratio in feeds were conducted to study the apparent monomer reaction rate and reactivity ratios of NVP and C2NVP, which indicated similar reaction rates and predominantly ideal random copolymers for the two monomers. The Tgs of the obtaining P(C2NVP-co-NVP) copolymers significantly corresponded to not only molecular weights MWs but also copolymer compositions. These copolymers presented characteristic lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) behavior. We then studied the cloud points (CPs) of the copolymers with varying MWs and compositions. With different MWs, the CPs were linearly decreased from ca. 51 to 45 \u00b0C. With different compositions, the CPs of the copolymers decreased from ca. 48 to 29 \u00b0C with C2NVP content (i.e., from 60.8 to 89.9 mol %). Fitting the CPs by the theoretical equation, the result illustrated that the introduction of more hydrophobic units of C2NVP suppressed the hydrophilic interaction between the polymer chain and water. We then successfully proceeded the chain extension through the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of \u03b5-caprolactone (CL) to the synthesis of a novel P(C2NVP-co-NVP)-b-PCL amphiphilic block copolymer (Mn,NMR = 14,730 and Mw/Mn = 1.59). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the block copolymer had a value of ca. 1.46 \u00d7 10\u22124 g/L. The block copolymer micelle was traced by dynamic light scattering (DLS), obtaining thermosensitive behaviors with a particle size of ca. 240 nm at 25 \u00b0C and ca. 140 nm at 55 \u00b0C, respectively.</jats:p>",

We investigated the optimum composition for the quaternary catalyst; the character of the catalyst; the reactivity of the four alkylene oxides during homopolymerization and copolymerization; the behavior of ECH, EO, and PO during terpolymerization; and glass transition temperatures of the copolymer and terpolymers. The results showed that the nitrogen\u2010containing electron donors are suitable as the third component, whereas oxygen\u2010containing electron donors are not. Water as the fourth component can increase the molecular weight of the homopolymer and copolymers of ECH.

Catalyst activity was affected by minor variations in the method of preparation and increased during the first few days of storage of the catalyst. Water, alcohols, and ketones acted as catalyst poisons. Technical pentane and crude propylene streams can replace the normally pure materials used in the preparation of the catalyst. Copolymers of butadiene with styrene or \u03b1-methylstyrene were slightly richer in the styrene than the corresponding emulsion copolymers, except when Circosol-2XH was present in the medium. This resulted in polymers less rich in styrene. Attempts to induce cross-linking by incorporation of vinyl crotonate or divinylbenzene into the polymers did not result in a tighter gel. In the polymerization of butadiene, there is a threshold concentration of catalyst below which no reaction occurs and above which the final conversion obtained rises rapidly to 100 per cent with increased catalyst concentration. The lower the concentration of inert diluents in the reaction system, the lower the threshold value. The intrinsic viscosity of the polymer increases as reaction temperature is raised and decreases as conversion proceeds. Intrinsic viscosities over 20 can be otained. In contrast, butadiene-styrene copolymers increase in intrinsic viscosity as conversion is increased and have a lower gel content. The intrinsic viscosity of the copolymers is much lower than for the polybutadiene samples and the catalyst requirement is higher. Polymerization will occur in the presence of butanes and butylenes, hydrocarbon oils such as Circosol-2XH, carbon black, and stearic acid although the catalyst requirements are thereby increased. Incorporation of such materials before or immediately after polymerization markedly improves the processability of the polymers. Physical evaluation of resulting masterbatches has indicated retention of desirable properties.</jats:p>",

Grafting polymerization of methyl methacrylate\u2010co\u2010ethyl acrylate was applied to modify the surface of acid soluble collagen (ASC). The main objective of this work is not only reducing the hydrophilic behavior of collagen on which has been concentrated so far but also successfully showed that the introduced co\u2010monomers onto ASC can alter the thermal behavior of the resulted copolymer. The level of branched copolymer significantly influenced the initial viscosity in studied co\u2010monomer feed ratios. The graft polymerization of collagen demonstrated the meaningful change in conductivity value of branched copolymer, where the copolymer in side chain with low dielectric constant covalently bonded onto the ASC. The increase in the co\u2010monomer feed ratio had no significant effect on conductivity value of copolymer, afterwards. The novelty of this work was determined to achieve the new copolymer onto the backbone of collagen to be used in specific thermally stabled end uses that the sufficient chain entanglements improve the flexibility of final product.

Ethylene chloride was used as a solvent and as an internal reference for analytical purposes. Reactions were carried out at 0 \u00b0C and at atmospheric pressure. Monomer concentrations were determined by vapor phase chromatography, and copolymer molecular structure analyses were carried out by physical and chemical methods including infrared spectroscopy, vapor pressure osmometry, hydroxyl end-group analysis, and chemical reduction of unsaturated linkages.The homopolymerization of tetrahydrofuran did not take place, whereas that of propylene oxide proceeded at a rapid rate. In the copolymerization of tetrahydrofuran with propylene oxide, the rate of disappearance of tetrahydrofuran was found to be independent of its concentration, but varied directly with the concentration of propylene oxide. Under similar conditions, the rate of disappearance of propylene oxide was found to be (a) proportional to the square of its concentration, and (b) inversely proportional to the concentration of tetrahydrofuran.Reactivity ratios varied between 1.3 and 1.8 for propylene oxide and between 0.1 and 0.6 for tetrahydrofuran. Molecular weights obtained by vapor pressure osmometry ranged between 460 and 740, and those obtained by hydroxyl end-group analysis ranged between 520 and 1\u2002660. Infrared spectra confirmed the presence of hydroxyl groups and ether linkages in the copolymers prepared. Results on terminal unsaturation were negative. </jats:p>",

The comonomer content of the copolymers obtained also decreased with the increase of the comonomer concentration in each copolymer. The evaluation of the monomer reactivity ratios indicates a preference for the propylene insertion regardless of the last inserted monomer unit in growing polymer chain in all the copolymerizations. The relative reactivity of \u03c9-alkenols was however significantly lower than that of non-polar analogues.

The effects of reaction time, AAc monomer concentration and reaction temperature on grafting behavior of AAc were systematically studied. Possible reaction kinetics of plasma\u2010induced graft copolymerization, starting from initial hydroperoxide decomposition, were proposed. Through the Arrhenius analysis about graft copolymerization kinetics of AAc monomers on PET surface, it was revealed that the activation energies of decomposition, propagation and termination were 98.4, 63.5, and 17.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The temperature around 80 \u00b0C was favorable not only for the formation of oxide radicals through the thermal decomposition of hydroperoxide on PET surface but also for the extension of graft copolymer chain through direct polymer grafting. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) grains grafted onto PET surfaces possessed relatively uniform size and both PAAc grain size and surface roughness increased with increasing the grafting degree of AAc. The increase of grain size with increasing grafting degree results from the possibility of forming long chain graft copolymers and their shielding of reactive sites. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An alternating copolymer was obtained in the copolymerization in THF, which proceeded without a chain transfer and a termination. Monomer reactivity ratios, r1 obtained by assuming the rate constant k22=0, were 0.12 (Li+), 0.11 (Na+), and 0.11 (K+) in THF at 0\u00b0C. The r1 value in benzene at 40\u00b0C, however, was affected by the counter ion as follows: 37 (Li+), 0.38 (Na+), and 0.05 (K+). With Li+ counter ion the values were 0.50 in dioxane at 30\u00b0C and 29 in n-heptane at 40\u00b0C.

With the continuous improvement of polyolefin catalysts, high\u2010performance polyolefin materials were synthesized by adjusting the chain microstructure, changing the comonomer type and comonomer insertion amount, among which the ethylene/\u03b1\u2010olefin random copolymer elastomer (POE) and olefin block copolymer elastomer (OBC) are the most famous and well accepted by the market. The excellent properties of POE and OBC first depend on their polymer chain microstructure. The chain microstructure of polyolefins is fundamentally determined by the catalysts, polymerization conditions, comonomer feed policies, and reaction engineering. High\u2010performance ethylene/\u03b1\u2010olefin copolymer elastomers are currently prepared by high\u2010temperature solution polymerization process, which needs to be carried out at a temperature above the melting point of the polymer and is beneficial to speed up the polymerization reaction rate and control the polyolefin chain microstructure. However, the high\u2010temperature solution polymerization process launched more stringent requirements for the olefin coordination polymerization catalyst. Systematic reports on catalysts for high\u2010temperature solution copolymerization of ethylene and \u03b1\u2010olefins are lacking. In this review, we screened some catalysts suitable for the controllable copolymerization and high\u2010temperature solution copolymerization of ethylene/\u03b1\u2010olefin based on the catalyst's heat resistance, copolymerization activity, comonomer insertion ability, molecular weight, and distribution of the copolymer, including traditional Z\u2013N catalysts, metallocene catalysts, and post\u2010metallocene catalysts.

On the basis of infrared and NMR spectroscopies of the copolymerization products, it was found that the catalyst systems consisting of Ti(O-n-Bu)4 and alkylaluminums can copolymerize vinyl chloride with ethylene, whereas those consisting of VCl4, VOCl3, Cr(acac)3, Mn(acac)3, or Co(acac)3 and alkylaluminums give polyethylene or a mixture of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene, and are otherwise inactive. Random copolymers were easily obtained by the use of the Ti(O-n-Bu)4-AlEt2Cl and Ti-(O-n-Bu)4-AlEtCl2 catalyst systems. However, with these catalyst systems, polyethylene was obtained, along with a random copolymer, at a high ethylene feed ratio. This fact indicates the existence of two kinds of active sites, responsible to the copolymerization and the ethylene polymerization respectively. The monomer reactivity ratios were found to be r1(vinyl chloride)=2.0 and r2(ethylene)=0.2 for the copolymerization by either the Ti(O-n-Bu)4-AlEt2Cl or the Ti-(O-n-Bu)4-AlEtCl2 catalyst system. The monomer reactivity ratios are not in agreement with those found in the conventional radical copolymerization. Though the copolymerization reaction was completely inhibited upon the addition of radical inhibitors, this does not seem to support a radical polymerization mechanism directly.</jats:p>",

In this way it has been possible to obtain elastomeric materials in a wide range of compositions with interesting thermal profiles and different polymeric architectures by simply modulating the alimentation feed and the (monomers)/(initiator systems) ratio. Especially, a complete study of the myrcene-styrene copolymers (PMS) was carried out, highlighting their tapered microstructures with high molecular weights (up to 159.8 KDa) and a single glass transition temperature. For PMS copolymer reactivity ratios, rmyr = 0.12 \u00b1 0.003 and rsty = 3.18 \u00b1 0.65 and rmyr = 0.10 \u00b1 0.004 and rsty = 3.32 \u00b1 0.68 were determined according to the Kelen\u2013Tudos (KT) and extended Kelen\u2013Tudos (exKT) methods, respectively. Finally, this study showed an easy accessible approach for the production of various elastomers by anionic copolymerization of renewable terpenes, such as myrcene, with commodities.</jats:p>",

Copolymerization proceeds by Activated Monomer mechanism. LA is consumed preferentially and at the later stages of copolymerization the reaction mixture is enriched with CL. In spite of that, random distribution of both units is observed and end\u2010groups are mainly \uf8ffLA\u2010OH groups and not \uf8ffCL\u2010OH groups. This is explained by the fact that to reach high conversion of both comonomers the relatively long reaction times are required and at those conditions transesterification reaction becomes significant. Thus the microstructure of copolymers and the nature of the end\u2010groups is governed by transesterification rather then by the kinetics of comonomers incorporation. \u00a9 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. The thermal and dimensional stability of the copolymers were improved. When the MA and FGE load increased from 1 mol% to 4 mol% of PO, the copolymers contained the gel contents of 11.0%\u201326.1% and their yields were about double that of the PPC. The 5% weight-loss degradation temperatures (Td,-5%) and the maximum weight-loss degradation temperatures (Td,max) increased from 149.7\u2013271.3 \u00b0C and from 282.6\u2013288.6 \u00b0C, respectively, corresponding to 217.1 \u00b0C and 239.0 \u00b0C of PPC. Additionally, the hot-set elongation tests showed that the copolymers exhibited elasticity and dimensional stability with the minimum permanent deformation of 6.5% which was far less than that of PPC of 157.2%, while the tensile strengths were a little lower than that of PPC because of the following two conflicting factors, cross-links and flexibility of the units formed by the introduced third monomers, MA and FGE. In brief, we provide a novel method of one-pot synthesis of PPC containing cross-linked networks. According to this idea, the properties would be more extensively regulated by changing the cross-linkable monomers.</jats:p>",

The progress in the copolymerization, polymerization yield, structure, and properties of the resulted OT/VA copolymers were systematically characterized by solution potential/temperature monitor, laser particle size, FTIR, UV\u2013vis, and thermogravimetry techniques. The results show that the diameter, spectral characteristics, solubility, film formability, electrical conductivity, and thermostability of the virgin polymer particles formed exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the OT/VA ratio, suggesting an occurrence of an oxidative copolymerization between OT and VA monomers. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The determination of the copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine with styrene copolymers real composition, formed under the conditions of precipitation copolymerization in CCl4, is described. For this, 4-vinylpyridine with styrene was copolymerized in different ratios. The composition of the obtained copolymers was determined according to 1H NMR spectroscopy. A comparison of the real copolymers composition with the theoretically calculated ones was performed as well. The copolymerization of styrene with 4-vinylpyridine was carried out in sealed ampoules in argon medium. Solutions of a concentration of 1.02 mol/l in CCl4 were prepared. The initiator azobisisobutyronitrile in the amount of 0.00106 mol/l was added. The copolymerization was carried out in a thermostat C1823 at T = 75 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C. The copolymerization time was 3 hours. The original ratio of monomers (4-vinylpyridine:styrene) = 6:1; 5:1; 4:1; 3:1; 2:1; 1:2; 1:3; 1:4; 1:5; 1:6. The composition of the obtained copolymers was determined according to 1H NMR spectroscopy. It was determined that copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine with styrene obtained by precipitation copolymerization in CCl4 were enriched by 4-vinylpyridine bonds. On the contrary, the calculation of the instant composition of the copolymers according to the literature shows that under the conditions of classical copolymerization in 4-vinylpyridine solution is less active than styrene. We calculated the theoretical relative constants of copolymerization of styrene with 4-vinylpyridine: r1 = 1.97; r2 = 0.93. Therefore, under the conditions of classical copolymerization in solution 4-vinylpyridine is less active than styrene (r2 &lt; r1). It was also found out that for the original molar content of styrene if it is greater than 0,85, it is not possible to synthesize by means of precipitation polymerization into CCl4 the copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine:styrene.</jats:p>",

When the S-enantiomer of Ini was used the distribution in copolymer chains at the beginning of polymerization is statistical, with alternacy tendency, changing next through a gradient region to homoblocks of Tmc. However, when R-Ini was used, the product formed was a gradient oligoblock one, with Tmc blocks prevailing at the beginning, changing to Lac blocks dominating at the end part of chains. Initiation of copolymerization with the mixture of both initiator enantiomers (S:R = 6:94) gave a multiblock copolymer of similar features but shorter blocks. Analysis of copolymerization progress required complex analysis of dilatometric data, assuming different molar volume contraction coefficients for units located in different triads. Comonomer reactivity ratios of studied copolymerizations were determined.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The anionic ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides, namely of ethylene oxide (EO), with anhydrides (AH) generally produces strictly alternating copolymers. With triethylborane (TEB)-assisted ROCOP of EO with AH, statistical copolymers of high molar mass including ether and ester units could be obtained. In the presence of TEB, the reactivity ratio of EO (rEO), which is normally equal to 0 in its absence, could be progressively raised to values lower than 1 or higher than 1. Conditions were even found to obtain rEO equal or close to 1. Samples of P(EO-co-ester) with minimal compositional drift could be synthesized; upon basic degradation of their ester linkages, these samples afforded poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) diol samples of narrow molar mass distribution. In other cases where rEO were lower or higher than 1, the PEO diol samples eventually isolated after degradation exhibited a broader distribution of molar masses because of the compositional drift of initial P(EO-co-ester) samples.</jats:p>",

Using this approach, the effects of monomer to water ratios and polymer volumes on the monomer mole fraction within the polymer particle phase in a nonpolymerizing system at thermodynamic equilibrium can be determined. Comparison of these monomer partitioning predictions with experiments for the monomer system methyl acrylate\u2014vinyl acetate shows good agreement.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>Catalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters (lactides, lactones) and cyclic ethylene phosphates is an effective way to process materials with regulated hydrophilicity and controlled biodegradability. Random copolymers of cyclic monomers of different chemical nature are highly attractive due to their high variability of characteristics. Aryloxy-alkoxy complexes of non-toxic metals such as derivatives of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy magnesium (BHT-Mg) complexes are effective coordination catalysts for homopolymerization of all types of traditional ROP monomers. In the present paper, we report the results of density functional theory (DFT) modeling of BHT-Mg-catalyzed copolymerization for lactone/lactide, lactone/ethylene phosphate and lactide/ethylene phosphate mixtures. \u03b5-Caprolactone (\u03b5-CL), l-lactide (l-LA) and methyl ethylene phosphate (MeOEP) were used as examples of monomers in DFT simulations by the Gaussian-09 program package with the B3PW91/DGTZVP basis set. Both binuclear and mononuclear reaction mechanistic concepts have been applied for the calculations of the reaction profiles. The results of calculations predict the possibility of the formation of random copolymers based on l-LA/MeOEP, and substantial hindrance of copolymerization for \u03b5-CL/l-LA and \u03b5-CL/MeOEP pairs. From the mechanistic point of view, the formation of highly stable five-membered chelate by the products of l-LA ring-opening and high donor properties of phosphates are the key factors that rule the reactions. The results of DFT modeling have been confirmed by copolymerization experiments.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>In toluene at 50 \u00b0C, the vinyl addition polymerization of 4-vinyl-cyclohexene (VCH) comonomers with ethylene is investigated using symmetrical metallocene (rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2) combined with borate/TIBA. To demonstrate the polymerizations\u2019 living character, cyclic VCH with linear-exocyclic\u03c0 and endocyclic\u03c0 bonds produces monomodal polymers, but the dispersity (\u0189) was broader. The copolymers obtained can be dissolved in conventional organic solvent and have excellent thermal stability and crystalline temperature (\u0394Hm), and their melting temperature (Tm) varies from 109 to 126 \u00b0C, and \u0394Hm ranges from 80 to 128 (J/g). Secondly, the distribution of polymeric catalysts engaged in polymer chain synthesis and the nature of the dormant state are two of the most essential yet fundamentally unknown aspects. Comprehensive and exhaustive kinetics of E/VCH have shown numerous different kinetic aspects that are interpreted as manifestations of polymeric catalysts or of the instability of several types of active center [Zr]/[C*] fluctuations and formation rates of chain propagation RpE, RpVCH, and propagation rate constants kpE and kpVCH, the quantitative relationship between RpE, RpVCH and kpE, kpVCH and catalyst structures, their constituent polymer Mw, and their reactivity response to the endocyclic and exocyclic bonds of VCH. The kinetic parameters RpE, RpVCH, kpE, and kpVCH, which are the apparent rates for the metallocene-catalyzed E/VCH, RpE, and kpE values, are much more significant than RpVCH and kpVCH at 120 s, RpE and RpVCH 39.63 and 0.78, and the kpE and kpVCH values are 6461 and 93 L/mol\u00b7s, respectively, and minor diffusion barriers are recommended in the early stages. Compared with previously reported PE, RpE and kpE values are 34.2 and 7080 L/mol\u00b7s. VCH increases the RpE in the initial stage, as we are expecting; this means that the exocyclic bond of VCH is more active at the initial level, and that the chain transfer reaction of cyclic internal \u03c0 double is increased with the reaction time. The tp versus Rp, kp, and [Zr]/[C*] fraction count may be fitted to a model that invokes deactivation of growing polymer chains. At tp 120\u2013360 s higher, the incorporation rate of VCH suppresses E insertion, resulting in reduced molecular weight.</jats:p>",

Copolymers were synthesized according to the ring\u2010opening polymerization (ROP) of the cyclic carbonate monomers, containing pendant ester groups. As an example, we chose copolymerization of ethyl 5\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010oxo\u20101,3\u2010dioxane\u20105\u2010carboxylate (MTC\u2010Et) with trimethylene carbonate (TMC), using zinc (II) and lanthanum (III) acetylacetonates as ROP initiators. The transesterification processes of ester groups in pendant, short chains, appearing during conducted copolymerization, led to the establishment of two different fractions: first\u2010branched and high molecular weight fraction and second\u2010linear and low molecular weight. The content of this high\u2010molecular\u2010weight fraction increased with both: the amount of MTC\u2010Et in started reaction mixture and the time of conducted copolymerization. Reactivity constants in studied reaction were determined. It was possible to obtain the copolymer fraction (ca. 30%) with molecular weight of up to a million g/mol, with a highly branched chain microstructure using lanthanum (III) acetylacetonate as initiator. Conclusions were based on detailed NMR analysis, determining microstructure of the copolymer chains and additionally on GPC and DSC measurement. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

The VCA content in the graft copolymers was always higher than in the copolymers obtained by homogeneous copolymerization using the same monomer feed composition. The monomer reactivity ratios, as well as a preferential partitioning of the monomers surrounding the polymeric substrate, were considered to explain the grafting reactions in the binary systems.</jats:p>",

With certain polyfunctional compounds this has been found to be the case. Some indication of copolymerization was observed with diethylene, trimethylene, and the butylene glycols and with ricinoleic acid, and solid polymers resulted from the interaction of thiodiglycol with tricarballylic acid, 2,2\u2032\u2010dihydroxydiethyl disulfide (DTG), MTG, and glycerol, respectively. The reactions with the last three hydroxy compounds were studied in detail and the properties of the copolymers produced assessed visually. MTG was found to undergo rapid autocondensation to form brittle solids. Similar polymers were obtained in about 70% yield with small amounts of TG in the reaction mixture; on an increase in the initial TG content, waxy solids, similar to those obtained from TG alone, resulted. As the glycerol content in TG/glycerol mixtures increased up to 40%, the copolymers formed changed from friable gels to brittle solids; any further increase resulted in viscous liquid products only. These results may be attributable to the fact that the reaction is a two\u2010stage one. TG\u2010MTG mixtures were reacted with glycerol with a view to improving the tensile strength of the product. This was successful, and the TG\u2010MTG\u2010glycerol (50:45:4) mixture, when heated at 154\u00b0 for 6.5 hr. gave a white, elastic solid, very difficult to cut or break, which could be milled and pressed although tending to swell in benzene and dichlorodiethyl ether. The properties and structures of these new thioplasts made, where possible, from equimolecular quantities of the monomers, are recorded and compared with those of the commercially available Thiokols. Attempts to copolymerize TG with compounds (I), (II), and (III), which contain the reactive 2\u2010hydroxyethylthio group were unsuccessful.</jats:p>",

        "Title": "Emergent sequence biasing in step-growth copolymerization: influence of non-bonded interactions and comonomer reactivities",
        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The phase behavior and material properties of copolymers are intrinsically dependent on their primary comonomer sequences. Achieving precise control over monomer sequence in synthetic copolymerizations is challenging, as sequence determination is influenced not only by the reaction conditions and the properties of the reactants, but also by the statistical nature of the copolymerization process itself. Mayo-Lewis reactivity ratios are often used to predict copolymer composition and sequence and are based on ratios of static reactivity constants. However, prior results have demonstrated that in a generic, solution-based step-growth A,B-copolymerization, relatively weak non-bonded attractions between certain monomer pairs induce emergent microphase separations. Such polymerization driven separations lead to deviations from standard kinetics, due to the emergent heterogeneities in reactant concentrations, which can also cause significant shifts in the resulting copolymer sequences. Previously, these effects were observed in systems where the activation energies were equal for all reaction pathways, that is, between all monomer pair combinations. In this work, we explore the combined effects on copolymerization kinetics of differences in both activation energies and non-bonded attractions between monomers and examine the sequences produced within this same step-growth copolymerization model. Our results indicate that altering activation energies influences the kinetics and sequences in a manner that also depends upon the non-bonded attractions, showing that these effects may work in concert or in opposition to one another to bias the sequences formed. Non-standard kinetic behaviors and long-range sequence biasing are observed under certain conditions, and the extent of each clearly shifts as the reaction proceeds. These findings provide insight into the complex interplay between sequence and nascent oligomer phase behavior, highlighting the potential for exploiting emergent phase properties in the informed design of advanced sequence-biased materials.</jats:p>",

In spite of the high reactivity of the ferrocene nucleus towards electrophilic substitution, no mode of propagation other than vinyl addition was detected when the infrared spectra of polymers prepared by cationic and free radical reactions were compared. The electronic spectra of polyvinylferrocene and its oxidized form were similar to those of ferrocene and ferricinium ion, respectively.

Examination of published results for AU and UG copolymers synthesized by polynucleotide phosphorylase permits evaluation of reactivity ratios for the AU copolymer and indicates that penultimate effects may be operative in both cases.</jats:p>",

In particular, their molecular weight distributions are broader, having polydispersities higher than two, and sometimes their chemical composition distributions may even be bimodal. In our previous publication, we developed a mathematical model to describe the polymerization kinetics and polymer microstructure of ethylene homopolymers made with a supported metallocene catalyst. In this article, we extended that model to also cover the copolymerization of ethylene and 1\u2010hexene with the same supported catalyst. The copolymerizations are performed in parallel semibatch reactors using a metallocene catalyst supported on an inorganic porous carrier. 1\u2010Hexene concentration and polymerization time are the factors changed to investigate this system. Modeling results show that, as for the ethylene homopolymerization case, a three\u2010site model is needed to describe the molecular weight distributions of the copolymers, but their chemical compositions can be described with a single set of reactivity ratios. A single set of parameters is also enough to describe the copolymerization kinetics with this supported catalyst. A new method is also developed and tested to estimate reactivity ratios under composition drift in this article.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>The \u201ccomonomer effect\u201d is an intriguing kinetic phenomenon in olefin copolymerization that still remains without a detailed explanation. It typically relates to the rate of enhancement undergone in ethylene and propene catalytic polymerization just by adding small fractions of an alpha-olefin. The difficulty lies in the fact that changes caused by the presence of the comonomer in reaction parameters are so conspicuous that it is really difficult to pin down which of them is the primary cause and which ones are side factors with marginal contribution to the phenomenon. Recent investigations point to the modification of the catalyst active sites as the main driving factor. In this work, the comonomer effect in the metallocene copolymerization of propene and 1-nonene is analysed and correlated to the comonomer role in the termination of the chain-growing process. The associated termination mechanisms involved furnish most of chain-free active sites, in which the selective interaction of the comonomer was proposed to trigger the insertion of monomers. A thorough characterisation of chain-end groups by means of the 1H NMR technique allows for detailing of specific transfer processes, ascribed to comonomer insertions, as well as evidencing the influence of the growing chain\u2019s microstructure over the different termination processes available.</jats:p>",

Specifically, alkyl lithium\u2010polymerized butadiene\u2013styrene and alkyl sodium\u2010polymerized <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u2010methylstyrene\u2013styrene are contrasted to the products of copolymerization of the same monomers by free\u2010radical mechanism.

The free\u2010radical copolymers, unlike the anionic copolymers, exhibit compositional heterogeneity in a batch reactor. Carrying out the polymerization reaction in a pipeline reactor gives results equivalent to the batch reactor if there is plug flow. However, if a parabolic profile exists in the reactor, there will be significantly increased compositional drift in the copolymer product and a broadened molecular weight distribution, with little effect on blocking. Recycle reactors, including the recirculating loop variety, seem effective in decreasing blocking. The extent of blocking may be considerably decreased in a wellmixed continuous stirred tank reactor. However, poor mixing will greatly increase both the extent of blocking and the compositional heterogeneity of the product.</jats:p>",

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>We perform a Monte Carlo simulation of irreversible template copolymerization near a chemically heterogeneous surface with a regular distribution of discrete adsorption sites that selectively adsorb from solution one of the two polymerizing monomers and the corresponding chain segments. In the polymerization model, the chain propagation process is simulated by adding individual monomers to the end of growing macroradical. We focus in this paper on the influence of polymerization rate, adsorption energy, and the distance between adsorption sites on the chain conformation and the primary sequence of the resulting two-letter (AB) copolymers and, specifically, on the coupling between polymerization and adsorption. The conditions for the realization of conformation-dependent copolymerization are formulated. For this regime, we observe the formation of a quasiregular copolymer with two types of alternating sections. One of them contains randomly distributed A and B segments. The second one consists mainly of strongly adsorbed A segments. It is found that the average length of the random sections is proportional to the distance between the nearest neighbor adsorption sites. The average length of the A-rich sections is determined by the \u201cadsorption capacity\u201d of adsorption site. By varying the strength of the effective monomer-substrate interaction and the distribution of adsorption sites on the substrate, the copolymers with different surface-induced primary sequences can be designed and synthesized in a controlled fashion.</jats:p>",

Diffusion of photogenerated acid in the copolymer films and the acid trapping capability of the basic BCVC units were investigated. The evaporation of acid was also studied by a spectral change of an indicator film that consisted of poly(vinyl alcohol) and tetrabromophenol blue sodium salt. It is found that only acid surviving deactivation by the BCVC units diffuses into unexposed areas and evaporates from the copolymer film. The evaporation of a low molecular weight basic additive is also examined. Whereas the low molecular weight basic additive is evaporated during baking, the basic monomer units in the copolymer are not evaporated at all. Thus, the copolymer with the basic monomer can control the acid diffusion and evaporation effectively. The new resist system enables us to form fine patterns even after a 2 h postexposure delay without any additional treatment.</jats:p>",

It was found that each of the above catalyst systems produces a random copolymer at Al/V molar ratios below 1.5; however, polyethylene is mainly obtained above the ratio of 1.5. With the VO(OEt)3/AlEt3 catalyst system, its good catalyst activity being in contrast with the inactivity of the Ti(O-n-Bu)4/AlEt3 catalyst system, the maximum catalyst activity was observed at the Al/V molar ratio of 0.5. The copolymerization rate decreased with an increase in the ethylene fraction in the monomer mixture, reaching a minimum value at a 80 mol% ethylene feed; however, the rate increased above this feed ratio with a further increase in the ethylene feed. The contamination of a copolymer with polyethylene which has been observed in the copolymerization by the Ti(O-n-Bu)4/AlEt2Cl or AlEtCl2 catalyst system was not observed in the present case. The monomer reactivity ratios for the copolymerization by the VO(OEt)3/AlEt3 catalyst system were found to be r1(vinyl chloride)=2.48 and r2(ethylene)=0.02. The reaction between VO(OEt)3 and AlEt3 was investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy and gasometry, and it was found that the average valency states of the V of the catalyst system is higher than four at the Al/V molar ratio range where a random copolymer is exclusively obtained.</jats:p>",

The influence of the kind of silsesquioxane and of the copolymerization conditions on the reaction performance and on the properties of the copolymers was studied. In the case of copolymerization of E/POSS-6-3, the positive comonomer effect was observed, which was associated with the influence of POSS-6-3 on transformation of the bimetallic ion pair to the active catalytic species.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most widely used conductive polymers in the growing conductive polymer industry is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), whose main advantages are good thermal and chemical stability, a conjugated backbone, and ease of functionalization. The main drawback of PEDOT for use as wearable electronics is the lack of stretchable and self-healing properties. This can be overcome by grafting PEDOT with flexible side branches. As pure PEDOT is highly stable and grafting would not be possible, a new bromine-functionalized thiophene derivative, 2-(tiophen-3-yl) ethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate (ThBr), was synthesized and copolymerized with EDOT for the synthesis of a poly(EDOT-co-ThBr) ATRP macroinitiator. After the synthesis of the macroinitiator, flexible polymers could be introduced as side branches by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to modify mechanical properties. Before this last synthesis step, the conditions for the synthesis of the ATRP macroinitiator should be investigated, as only functionalized units can function as grafting sites. In this study, nine new copolymers with different monomer ratios were synthesized to investigate the reactivity of each monomer. The ratios used in the different syntheses were ThBr:EDOT = 1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, 1:0.8, 1:1, 0.8:1, 0.6:1, 0.4:1, and 0.2:1. In order to determine the effect of reaction time on the final properties of the polymer, macroinitiator synthesis at a 1:1 ratio was carried out at different time periods: 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The obtained products were characterized by different techniques, and it was found that polymerizations longer than 24 h yielded practically insoluble macroinitiators, thus limiting its further application. Reactivity ratios of both monomers were found to be similar and close to 1, making the copolymerization reaction symmetrical and the obtained macroinitiators almost random copolymers.</jats:p>",

By single-factor tests, the optimum graft copolymerization conditions with higher grafting efficiency and grafting percent ratio correspond to the reaction time of 3h, the graft polymerization reaction temperature of about 65\u00b0C, the initiator concentration of 9.7\u00d710-3mol/L, the mixed grafting monomers concentration of 1.0 mol/L, the volume ratio of vinyl acetate to butyl acrylate of 5:5. The starch graft copolymer after purification was characterized, and its properties were determined. IR spectra of graft copolymers indicated that the carbonyl group characteristic absorption peak existed at 1730\uff5e1740cm-1 besides that of starch. The XRD pattern showed there were several dispersion peaks, therefore the graft copolymerization was the concomitant structure of a little crystalline state and amorphous state. TG and DTA curves confirmed the occurrence of graft copolymerization, and showed that the thermal stability of starch copolymer was better than that of pure corn starch. Starch based wood adhesive is white or cream white emulsion paste, excellent emulsive properties and high temperature stability.

The allowable half\u2010life of the initator is a function of the residence time. When all the reactors are equal in volume so that the residence time is the same in each, it can be shown that the incremental conversion in each successive reactor must decrease in a well\u2010ordered manner. As a specific example, a copolymerization is postulated with total polymer concentration restricted to the region where viscosity is manageable with conventional mixing equipment.

The copolymer composition drifting was minor in this living copolymerization system despite of a batch process. It was found that the polymerization heterogeneity had a severe effect on the copolymerization kinetics, with the apparent reactivity ratios in slurry significantly different from those in solution. The reactivity ratios were nearly independent of polymerization temperature in the range of 0\u201335 \u00b0C. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part A: Polym Chem, 2013</jats:p>",

The fine structure of wood\u2010polymer(copolymer) composites was determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The presence of homopolymer and copolymers increased the mechanical properties of the wood. The compressive strength and Brinell Hardness Numbers, determined for untreated and treated wood samples, indicated that the mechanical strength of wood\u2010polymer (copolyrner) was significantly increased in the presence of P(AGE/MMA). At maximum percent conversion, the percentage increase in the compressive strength with regard to the applied force perpendicular to the fibers in spruce was 218%. After aging for 28 days, it was found that there were no significant changes in mechanical stability.</jats:p>",

Three policies were considered. In the first, both monomers are added under starved conditions. In the second, the reactor is initially chanrged with all of the less reactive monomer plus the amount of the mono reactive monomer needed to initially form a copolymer with the desired composition. Subsequent addition of the remaining monomer is made at a flow rate that ensures the formation of a copolymer of of constant composition. In the third, the initial charge is the same as in the previous case with subsequent addition of the remaining monomer at a constant fed rate. The copolymer composition obtained under starved conditions was almost constant in the cases where low feed rates were used. however, this led to long process times. For the second policy, a mathematical model ws developed to calculated the necessary addition rate of the more reactive monomer, that ensured the production of a copolymer of constant composition. It was found that the resulting process time was one third of that corresponding to the starved process. When variations in a copolymer composition were allowed, the third addition polycy might prove to be a good alternative to the second addition polyce because of iots shorter process time and teh advantage of working with teh constant feed rate.</jats:p>",

The centers differ in two aspects: their ability to incorporate \u03b1\u2010olefin units into copolymer chains (i.e., their reactivity ratios) and the average molecular weights of the polymer chains they produce. The centers of different populations are formed at different rates and have different kinetic stabilities.

This approach is based on an algorithm for parameter estimation in differential equations and uses the time evolution of the conversions of the monomers in chemically initiated seeded emulsion copolymerizations. The approach is used to estimate the kinetic parameters of a mathematical model useful for predictive work. This mathematical model includes material balances for the monomers, population balances for particles containing <jats:italic>i</jats:italic> radicals and the free radical balance in the aqueous phase. Analysis of the variability of the parameters of the model during polymerization showed changes as large as 18% in the values of the parameters. These values were mainly due to changes in the particle size rather than to a shift in the composition of the reaction mixture. Combination of the present approach with methods for both parameter estimation in emulsion homopolymerization and estimation of reactivity ratios in emulsion copolymerization systems allows a reasonable good estimation of these varying kinetic parameters as constant parameters. Additionally, it was found that when the dependence of the parameters on the particle size was included in the estimation process, the parameters of the model were accurately estimated.</jats:p>",

Synergistic effects were found in the resulting helical copolymers, enabling one certain copolymer to show the maximum CD signal intensity. Moreover, the helicity of the helical copolymers in nanoparticle state was opposite to that in solution state. This is the first demonstration that synergistic effects and helicity inversion simultaneously occurred in helical copolymers prepared by emulsion copolymerization process. To deepen the understanding of the unique phenomena, corresponding solution copolymerization and emulsification process were also investigated. Different from \u201cSergeant and Soldiers rule\u201d approach, the present study provides a new strategy for preparing chirally helical polymer particles by making full use of achiral monomers. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

        "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Summary:</jats:bold> A series of new poly(aryl ether ketone\u2010benzoxazole)s (PAEKBOs) with hexafluoroisopropylidene moieties were synthesized directly by the aromatic nucleophilic polycondensation of 2,2\u2032\u2010bi[2\u2010(4\u2010fluorophenyl)benzoxazol\u20106\u2010yl]hexafluoropropane(6F\u2010BO), 4,4\u2032\u2010difluorobenzophenone (DFBP) and 4,4\u2032\u2010(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol (6F\u2010OH) at various molar ratios. High molecular weight polymers with both benzoxazole and ether\u2010ketone units were readily obtained. The copolymers with &gt;20 mol\u2010% content of ether\u2010ketone units were highly soluble in organic solvents such as <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010pyrrolidone (NMP), <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010dimethylacetamide (DMAc), <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>,<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\u2010dimethylformamide (DMF), <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>\u2010cresol, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and CHCl<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. The thermal stability of PAEKBOs was not significantly compromised compared with the relevant homopolymer compositions, hexafluoroisopropylidene containing poly(aryl ether ketone) (6F\u2010PAEK) without benzoxazole units and hexafluoroisopropylidene containing poly(ether benzoxazole) (6F\u2010PEBO) without ether\u2010ketone units. A 5% weight loss of the copolymers occurred at above 440\u2009\u00b0C in air and above 480\u2009\u00b0C in N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Single glass transition temperatures (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>g</jats:sub>s) were observed and ranged from 182 to 228\u2009\u00b0C depending on the composition of the copolymers. The PAEKBO copolymers were essentially in the amorphous state, as determined using DSC, WAXD and DMA. For polymer films with a thickness of 30\u201380 \u00b5m, moduli between 1\u2009700 and 2\u2009100 MPa and strengths between 40 and 90 MPa were achieved.

        "Abstract": "<jats:p>This work presents the results of research on the preparation of bioresorbable functional polyestercarbonates containing side carboxyl groups. These copolymers were synthesized in two ways: the classic two-step process involving the copolymerization of l-lactide and a cyclic carbonate containing a blocked side carboxylate group in the form of a benzyl ester (MTC-Bz) and its subsequent deprotection, and a new way involving the one-step copolymerization of l-lactide with this same carbonate, but containing an unprotected carboxyl group (MTC-COOH). Both reactions were carried out under identical conditions in the melt, using a specially selected zinc chelate complex, with Zn[(acac)(L)H2O] (where: L\u2014N-(pyridin-4-ylmethylene) phenylalaninate ligand) as an initiator. The differences in the kinetics of both reactions and their courses were pictured. The reactivity of the MTC-COOH monomer without a blocking group in the studied co-polymerization was much higher, even slightly higher than l-lactide, which allowed the practically complete conversion of the comonomers in a much shorter time. The basic final properties of the obtained copolymers and the microstructures of their chains were determined. The single-step synthesis of biodegradable polyacids was much simpler. Contrary to the conventional method, this made it possible to obtain copolymers containing all carbonate units with carboxyl groups, without even traces of the heavy metals used in the deprotection of the carboxyl groups, the presence of which is known to be very difficult to completely remove from the copolymers obtained in the two-step process.</jats:p>",
