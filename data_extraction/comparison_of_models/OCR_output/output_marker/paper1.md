SUMMARY: 
Free radical copolymerization of methacrylic acid (MA) with styrene (St) at 60"C, initiated by **2,2'-azoisobutyronitrile** (AIBN) is carried out in hydrogen-bond forming solvents and in solvents not capable of forming hydrogen bonds but exhibiting different dielectric constants. 

The influence of the solvent on copolymerization reactivity ratios, rate of polymerization, composition, molecular weight and polydispersity of the copolymers obtained is shown. The reactivity ratios of methacrylic acid **TMA** and of styrene *rst* are determined by two different methods with good agreement. The values obtained by the Kelen-Tiidbs method are as follows: 
in carbon tetrachloride: **rMA** = 0,54 f 0,Ol; *rst* = 0,06 f 0,03; 
in chloroform: rm = 0,51 f 0,Ol; rst = *0,08* f 0,03; 
in acetone: **rMA** = 0,43 f 0,OO; *rst* = 0,65 f 0,02; 
in 1,Cdioxane: **rMA** = 0,41 f 0,02; **rst** = 0,59 f 0,05; 
in acetonitrile: rm. 7 *0,06* k 0,02; **rst** = 0,29 f 0,OO.

Changes of reactivity ratios depending on the medium are explained on the basis of the results 

## Introduction

Many papers deal with the influence of the reaction medium on the rate of polymerization, the molecular weight, the structure and the reactivity ratios of unsaturated carboxylic acids's2). It is known3) that depending on the medium carboxylic acids can associate via hydrogen bonds to dimers or linear plurimolecular aggregates: 
These associates exist in nonpolar (inert) solvents and decompose in solvents capable of hydrogen bond formation with the COOH group as well as in polar solvents not capable of hydrogen bond formation. Formation and decomposition of such aggregates may influence the rate of polymerization, the steric arrangement in the polymer and the behaviour of the monomers in the copolymerization process. 

The effect of hydrogen bond formation on the reactivity of unsaturated carboxylic acids has been investigated first for the systems methacrylic acid/methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid/styrene following their copolymerization in bulk and in N, N- 
dimethylformamide **(DMF)4).** Later, the copolymerization of methacrylic acid (MA) 
and acrylamide with styrene (St) and methyl methacrylate in various solvents have been studieds-*). So far, there are no detailed data describing the influence of solvents differing in their chemical nature on the reactivity of MA in its copolymerization with St. 

The present paper is an attempt to cover this gap. The copolymerization of MA 
with St was carried out in hydrogen bonding solvents (acetone, 1,Cdioxane) and in others, not possessing this feature, but exhibiting different dielectric constants 
(carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, acetonitrile). 

## Experimental Part

Reagents: Methacrylic acid from Fluka, distilled i. vac., b. p. (5 mmHg) = 513 "C. Styrene from SE "Neftochim" Bourgas, free of stabilizers, twice distilled i. vac. Z,Z'-Azoisobutyronitrile from Fluka, recrystallized from ethanol, m. p. = 102 - 103 "C. Carbon tetrachloride purum, from Laborchemie Apolda DDR, dried with CaC12, distilled and kept with molecular sieve (4 A). *Chloroform,* p. a. from Factory for pure reagents, Vladaja, Bulgaria, dried with CaCb, distilled and kept with moleculr sieve (4 A). *Acetone,* purified from aldehydes by treatment with silver nitrate and sodium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred for 10 min, the obtained precipitate filtered off and dried with sodium carbonate. After filtration the acetone is distilled, b. p. = 55 OC, and kept with molecular sieve (4 A). *Z,4-Dioxane,* p. a. from Fluka, dried over sodium and distilled. *Acetonitrile,* purum from Fluka. Deuterochloroform, *99,95070* D, from Chemapol, Chechoslovakia; perdeuteroacetonitrile, *85,00070* D, from Isokomerz, DDR; perdeuteroacetone, **99,70%** D, from Isokomerz, DDR; perdeutero-Z,4-dioxane, *99,00070* D, from Merck, BRD. 

Copolymerization: To 1 mol/l solutions of mixtures with different mole ratios of monomers 
0,5 mol-070 (with reference to both monomers) of **2,2'-azoisobutyronitrile** was added. The solutions were placed into glass amfiules, twice frozen and evacuated mmHg). The sealed ampoules were heated in a thermostat at 60Â°C for a fixed time. In carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and acetonitrile the copolymers fell out as white precipitates, which were filtered, dissolved in methanol or 1 ,Cdioxane and reprecipitated in petroleum ether. In acetone and 
1,4-dioxane the polymerization in the ampoules, containing up to 50 mol-070 MA was homogeneous and in those with over 50 mol-070 MA it was heterogeneous. In the first case the polymers obtained were precipitated in ethanol and in the second - after filtration - the products were dissolved in methanol and precipitated in diethyl ether. 

All polymers were purified by reprecipitation from a suitable solvent and dried i.vac. 

(1 mmHg) at 25 "C. 

Analyses: The polymers were analysed for the content of MA. The samples were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or a mixed solvent THF/methanol and titrated with 0,l M solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol in the presence of Thymol-blue as indicator. 

The determination of the reactivity ratios of the monomers and the errors, as calculated by the least squares method, was conducted according to the method of Fineman and Rossg) with a 
"Hewlett-Packard" calculator, model HP *85,* USA, and according to the Kelen-TUdOs method lo). 

The ${}^{1}$H NMR spectra were recorded at 80 MHz with a spectrometer Tesla BS 487 C of solutions in the estimated analogs of the solvents used for the copolymerization and tetrahydrising an internal reference. For the determination of the stability constant of the complex between MA and St in chloroform 10 w.t.-% to solutions of MA and mixtures of MA and St in mole ratios between 1:0,5 and 1:3 in deuterium-chloroform were used. The results were treated according to the Hanna-Ashabauagh method[10], based on the following equation:

$$\frac{1}{\Delta\left(\text{A}\right)}=\frac{1}{K\cdot\Delta\left(\text{A}\right)}\cdot\frac{1}{m_{\text{D}}}=-\frac{1}{\Delta\left(\text{A}\right)}$$

## Results And Discussion

As already known12), depending on the solvent, methacrylic acid (MA) can exist in the following forms: monomer (I), dimer (11), associated with a molecule of the solvent S **(111)** and associated with a carboxylic group of the growing chain of the polymer P (IV): 
The following scheme shows the equilibria between these forms: 
Forms (11) and (IV), existing in bulk and in nonpolar solvents (benzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, exhibit a higher reactivity as compared with form (111) 
which predominates in polar and hydrogen-bonding solvents. This is due to the complementary resonance stabilisation of the carboxylic dimer, allowing a x-electron cloud transfer through the H-bridge and causing partial delocalization of the x-electrons. The unpaired electron of the corresponding radical is considerably delocalized, too. This way of resonance stabilization is not possible for the solvated carboxylic acid (111) and the corresponding radical. 

It is supposed, therefore, that the nature of the solvent influences the reactivity of the unsaturated carboxylic acids by shifting the association equilibria **Eqs.** (I) - (5) 
according to the ability of the solvent to form H-bonds with the acid. 

That is why for the copolymerization of MA with St we have chosen hydrogen bonding solvents (acetone, 1,4dioxane) and solvents not possessing this feature but having different polarities (carbon tetrachloride), chloroform, acetonitrile). As 
'H NMR and IR spectroscopy are the most suitable methods for studying hydrogen bonds, we have taken the spectra of MA in the solvents used. The 'H NMR spectra of MA in chloroform and acetonitrile (Fig. 1) and in 1,4dioxane and acetone (Fig. 2) 
show convincingly the influence of the solvent. As already found in our previous papers13), it is the carboxylic proton # which is most sensitive to the change of the solvent. It can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2 that in chloroform the signal of the # 
proton appears at lower field, which agrees with other observations on hydrogen bonds14). 

In acetonitrile this signal is shifted to higher field by **7,125** p.p.m. In hydrogen bonding solvents the w peak is positioned between those in chloroform and acetonitrile. 1 ,CDioxane forms hydrogen bonds but the signal of the proton is situated at stronger field compared to chloroform where MA exists in its most reactive form 
(11). This shows that in 1,4dioxane the less active form (111) predominates. The w peak in acetone (forming H-bonds **and** having a relatively high dielectric constant) is strongly shifted to higher field and is positioned near to the signal in acetonitrile. In these two solvents the associates MA/solvent predominate, which are formed either through hydrogen bonds or by polar interactions. This may cause the different reactivity of MA in its copolymerization with St in different solvents. 

The chemical shifts of -CH2- 
and -CH, protons (Tab. 1) are only slightly affected by the solvent. 

The data from the IR spectra fully agree with the results obtained by the 'H NMR 
study (Tab. 2). The absorption band of the stretching vibration of the CC double bond is slightly affected by the solvent, whereas that of the **COOH** group is shifted toward higher wave number by 29 - 31 cm-' on replacing chloroform by 1,4-dioxane or acetonitrile. This shift is in agreement with the changes observed in the absorption maxima upon hydrogen bond f~rmation'~). 

The alteration in the position of the absorption band for the OH group confirms the data obtained by the 'H NMR study. 

These shifts express the changes in the association equilibria Eqs. (1) - (3) due to the transition from nonpolar to hydrogen-bonding solvents. These results show that depending on the capability of the solvent to form hydrogen bonds the differences in the reactivity of the monomers are to be expected. 

The data for the copolymerization of MA with St in various solvents, shown in Tab. 3, prove the changes observed in the 'H NMR and IR spectra. It is seen from Tab. 3 that the rate up to **10%** conversion depends on the nature of the solvent used.

The highest copolymerization rate is observed in chloroform and in carbon tetrachloride, the lowest in acetone. The contents of MA in the initial mixture *also* affect the copolymerization rate. Regardless of the solvent used, an increase of the MA cancentration in the initial mixture leads to an increase of the copolymerization rate. 

The nature of the solvent does not only affect the rate of copolymerization, but also affects the composition of the polymers obtained. Hydrogen bond formation between monomeric MA and solvent (1,4-dioxane or acetone), connected with a decrease in MA reactivity, leads to a decrease of the MA content in the copolymers. 

The same influence has been found in DMF, pyridine16) and quinolinel'). 

From the data in Tab. 3 the reactivity ratios r of the monomers in the five solvents used have been calculated by two different methods with good agreement (Tab. 4). In chloroform and carbon tetrachloride where the reactive dimer **(11)** of MA predominates, *r,,* has the highest value and *r,,* the lowest one. These results are close to the r-values for copolymerization in bulk4) *( f M A*  = 0,66; *rst* = **0,2).** When going from chloroform or carbon tetrachloride to hydrogen-bonding solvents (acetone, 1,4-dioxane) *f M ,*  decreases. In acetonitrile (having the highest dielectric constant) f M A  
reaches its lowest value. The alteration of *r,,* is accompanied by an alteration of the rst values. With a decrease of k2, (r,, 
= kll /kI2, rst = *k,/k2,)* the rs,-values increase.

MA could associate except with its own molecules or with the solvent with St molecules via donor-acceptor interactions: 

$$\mathrm{MA\ +\ St\ \ =\ \ [MA\ +\ St]}$$
The stability constant of this complex, as calculated by the Hanna-Ashbaugh method on the basis of the #-proton shifts in the 'H 
NMR spectra of MA/St mixtures of different mole ratios in deuterochloroform (Tab. *5),* exhibits the not very high value of 0,11 1.mol-'. This shows that in chloroform the complexes of hydrogen-bonded MA molecules predominate. 

It was interesting to see how far the nature of the solvent influences the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the obtained polymers. That is why we investigated the MA-St copolymers by means of gel permeation chromatography **(GPC).** The elution curves are given in Fig. 3 and the numerical data for the polydispersity and the

molecular weights in Tab. 6. Comparing these results with the r values obtained (Tab. 

4), we found a correlation between the r,, alteration and polydispersity. The copolymers with the highest molecular weight and low polydispersity were obtained by copolymerization of MA with St in chloroform.
