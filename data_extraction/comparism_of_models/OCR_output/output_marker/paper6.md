The kinetics of polymerization of methaeryhc acid sulpholanate (MAS) of its copolymemzatlon with methyl methacrylate, styrene and methacryhc acid were investigated. An increased activity of M_AS was notmed, when compared with the majority of known methacrylates, in the radical polymerazatlon reactions. 

SULPHUR contaming polymers have a number of valuable properties, especially heat, temperature, light and chemical stability [1-4], large dielectric and physite-chemical characteristics [1, 5], good adhesion to various materials [6]. This type of polymer has been given much attention in recent years [7, 8, 10]. The polymerization of sulphur containing vinyl monomers and their copolymerization with various other monomers represents a very promising method of synthesizing sulphur containing polymers, and of modifying already widely used ones. 

The sulpholanates of unsaturated acids belong to the interesting monomers [9]. 

No information could be found in the literature to their polymerization kinetics. We therefore describe in this report the results of studying the radical homoand copolymerization kinetics of MAS, and some of the properties of our products. 

## Experimental

The MAS [CI-I~--C--COO--~--~.~'\ has a b p = 15S°C/1 mmHg; n~ a 1 5028, dl°l 215, l I

m.p = 39-40°C. Elemental analyms gave: (~). 47 0 C, 6 0 H, 15 8 S. The absorption bands found m the infrared (IR) spectra (cm -1) are: 1132, 1143, 1287, 1328 (SOs-groups); 1378, 
1448, 2960 (CHs-groups); 1400, 2920 (CH,-groups); 947, 1017, 1630, 3020, 3040 (C--~C 
bonds); 1132 (--COC-groups); 1715 (O~--C-groups). 

Styrene and methyl methacrylatc (MM) were purified by the usual methods [11], the b.p. of styrene was 42°C/15 mmHg, n~°=l 5465. The MM had b p =46°C/100 mmHg, n~ ° 1 4130. The methacrylm amd (MA) was drmd over anhydrous calcmm chlomde and was thrme vacuum distilled; b p. ~--~44 5°C/2 mmHg, n~ ° 1 4315. The azmsobutyrodmltmle (AIBN) 
was reerystalhzcd three times flom methanol and then vacuum drmd to constant wmght; 
m.p.: 102°C. All the solvents used m the polymemzatlons were purLCled by the usual methods 
[12] and had the tabulated characteristics. 

The kmetms of homo- and eopolymerlzatmn were studmd by dflatometry at low convcrmon (less than 10~/o) m the presence of AIBN (0.01 ~ w/w) The dflatemeters were fused after evacuatmn to 10-8-10-4mmHg. In all cases, with the exeeptmn of the determination of the order of reactmn with respect to monomer, the monomer to solvent ratm used was 
1 : 1. Contractmn coefficmnt K of MAS was estabhshed after several tests from the polymer yaeld at 50°C; it was 0 142. An estimate of K for the copolymemzatmn was based on the addltlwty pnnclple using the kno~ values of K of other monomers [13, 14]. 

The polymers were purffied by 3-4 repreclpltatmns followed by vacuum drymg at 
60°C. The homopolymer was repreclpltated with sulphate ether from DMF. The solvents and prec~p~tants used to purify the copolymers are given m Table 1. The copolymer compomtmns were determined by elemental analys~s. The copolymemzatlon constants were determined by the method deserlbed by Mayo and Lewm [15]. 

## Results

The kinetics of polymerization of MAS were studied in DMF, DMSO and benzene as solvents. There were difficulties in the latter due to the heterogeneity of the medium at higher M_AS concentrations. 

Table 2 and Figs. 1, 2 show that the nature of the solvent does not affect the rate of MAS polymerization. The orders of reactions with respect to monomer and initiator found graphically were 1 and 0.5 respectively (Fig. 1, 2), which indicates the presence of the usual mechanism of radical polymerization with a bimolecular chain termination. It was interesting to note that the rate of M_AS polymerization exceeded that of numerous known methacrylates; this is probably

evidence of the high activity of MAS in the copolymerizations. The explanation is, judging from the large Q-values calculated for M_AS by the Alfrey-Price method [18] on the M_AS copolymerization with ~ 
and styrene, the increase of the conjugation energy of the monomer. The Q-value for MAS was not calculated, according to the results of its copolymerization with MA due to dependence of Q on the type of comonomer and medium in this case [19, 20]. 

The rate of the bulk eopolymerization of MAS with styrene increased on raising the content of the first monomer in the original mixture (Fig. 3b). This is probably the consequence of bIAS radicals being more reactive than those of styrene. In the case of MM as comonomer in benzene as solvent (Fig. 3a), or ~ 
in DMF (Fig. 3c) (using small MAS additions), the reverse was true, i,e. 

the rate of eopolymerization dropped as the MA~S content increased in the substrate. This indicates the MAS radicals to be less reactive than those of ~IM or MA. 

The cross termination constants ~ became smaller on changing from MAS-styrene to MAS--MM, while value of %.r~ became larger (Table 3). This is explained by the monomers having different polarities in the first case, but similar ones in the second. There was in system iVIAS-MM the same tendency for cross termination (~----5). Undesirably large values of ~ were encountered during the copolymerization of MAS with MA and the explanation must be sought in the solvent, i.e. DMF, which easily formed complexes with MA. 

Poly-MAS is a white powder soluble in DIV[F and DMSO, but insoluble in benzene, acetone, chloroform, dioxane,,butyl acetate, alcohols, paraffins. Typical IR-speetral absorption lines are (em-1): 1120, 1135, 1307 (SOj-groups); 1185 
(RCOOR'-groups); 1720 (CO-groups). The molecular weight (mol.wt.) of the polymer produced in DMF at 60°C, determined by light-scattering, was 880,000 ([~]=0.79 in DMF at 20°C). 

Thermomechanical testing showed two transition temperatures, i.e. the softening temp.=197°C, flow temp. -- 250°C, start of decomposition at about 
240°C. 

The copolymers were white powders. Table 1 shows the solubilities of the copolymers, typical IR-spectral absorption lines and the thermomechanieal properties. The mol.wt of the ]VIM copolymer containing 12.8% MAS produced in benzene at 50°C was 800,000. The insertion of the 1KAS units into the copolymer with styrene or MM raised the softening temperature and that of flow. The MA copolymers with MAS had lower softening and flow temperatures than the polymethacrylic acid alone.

The polymerization of mothylvmylsdyl-bls-e-caprolactam (MVSC) and methylvmylsflyl-bm-?-pyrrolldone (MVSP), and theLr copolymermatlon with methyl methacrylabe (MM) or styrene, were stuched. Some of the kmetm principles of these processes were also stuched and the rate constants for the formation of gel were calculated. 

The thermomechanical and thermogravimetrie propertms of the homo- and copolymers and their infrared spectra are also described. 

THE aim of the work reported here was to study the polymerization of methylvinylsilyl-bis-e-caprolactam 
(MVSC) 
and methylvinylsilyl-bis-?-pyrrolidone 
(MVSP), and their copolymerizations with methyl methacrylate (MM) or styrene 
[1]. 

Bulk polymerization of MVSC and MVSP was carried out in the presence of 1 ~/o w/w dieumyl peroxide under a nitrogen stream at 120°C. These processes yielded crosslinked polymers as solid, elastic and transparent materials which were not soluble in organic solvents.
