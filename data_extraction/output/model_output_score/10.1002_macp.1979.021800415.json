    "table_quality": 6.5,
    "(There is only one main table (Tab. 1), which is relatively simple and well-structured. However, it lacks grid lines and has footnotes that could be misinterpreted or missed during extraction. Other data are embedded in text or figures, not structured in tables.)": "",
    "quality_of_numbers": 8.5,
    "(Numbers are clearly printed and easy to read. Superscripts, subscripts, and units are well-formatted. However, some values are embedded in dense text or figures, which may slightly increase the chance of misreading.)": "",

    "(The paper discusses copolymerization kinetics and mechanisms in detail, but does not report any r-values for monomer pairs. It focuses on the effect of Lewis acid concentration, particularly ZnCl\u2082 and Zn(NO\u2083)\u2082, on the rate of copolymerization of acrylonitrile and styrene. No r-values are provided.)": "",
