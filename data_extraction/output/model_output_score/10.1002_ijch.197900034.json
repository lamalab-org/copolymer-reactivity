    "table_quality": 6.0,
    "(There are no formal tables, but the r-values are clearly presented in figure captions and within the text. The lack of structured tables makes automated extraction harder, but the data is still accessible.)": "",
    "quality_of_numbers": 8.0,
    "(The numerical values, especially r-values, are clearly printed and easy to read. They are mostly found in figure captions and inline text, with minimal distortion or ambiguity.)": "",
