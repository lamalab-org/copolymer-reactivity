    "table_quality": 2.0,
    "(There are no structured tables with r-values or tabulated data. Most data is embedded in the text or figures, making automated extraction difficult. Manual parsing is required.)": "",

    "(Numbers are clearly printed and easy to read in the text. However, since they are not in tables, context parsing is needed, which slightly increases the chance of misinterpretation.)": "",
