Thus, monomer reactivity ratios at the 95% confidence level were determined to be 1.29 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.96 \u00b1 0.2 for acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate, respectively, which were valid under the specific system conditions (i.e., solvent and temperature) studied. The results are useful for the development of acrylonitrile (&lt;90%) and methyl acrylate, melt\u2010processable copolymer fibers and films, including precursors for carbon fibers. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

With the exception of monomers containing \u03b2\u2010chloroethoxy group attached to the phosphorus atom, polymers obtained from the dialkyl vinyl phosphates had higher molecular weights than the corresponding dialkyl vinyl phosphonates. Dialkyl isopropenyl phosphates polymerized less readily than the dialkyl vinyl phosphates and diethyl styryl phosphate did not polymerize at all. An attempt is made to explain these results in terms of steric hindrance, charge distribution, and chain transfer. Examination of the copolymerization products, with a number of techniques used, indicates that these consist of polymers with a wide range of compositions and molecular weights. The copolymers with methyl methacrylate appear to consist of a large block of poly(methyl methacrylate) at one end and a smaller block of polymer formed from the vinyl phosphate or phosphonate at the other.

The experimental method was based on frequent measurement of the monomer feed composition throughout the copolymerization reaction by means of quantitative gas\u2010chromatographic analysis. Highly accurate monomer reactivity ratios were estimated in a statistically justified manner by a nonlinear least\u2010squares method applied to the integrated copolymer equation. The reactivity of the vinyl ester monomers towards an ethylene radical increased with decreasing electron\u2010with\u2010drawing ability of the ester group. All vinyl ester radicals considered turned out to have the same preference for their own monomer over ethylene (constant <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 1.50). Reactivity ratios are discussed in terms of the <jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>\u2013<jats:italic>e</jats:italic> scheme and the Taft relation. It appeared that chiefly polar factors contribute to the observed relative reactivity, while probably resonance stabilization only plays a minor part. Steric hindrance seems to impair monomer reactivity, only from vinyl pivalate on. Relative reactivities of the vinyl esters are compared with literature values, where other reference monomers have been used.</jats:p>",

    "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The possibility of controlling the composition of acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymers by controlling the pH and the ionic strength of the reaction medium is investigated. The reactivity ratios of charged monomers depend on the pH of the medium, acrylic acid is the more reactive monomer below pH 3 and acrylamide above pH 4. The working pH was set at 3.6, a candidate for the crossover point, where no composition drift is expected. Copolymerization kinetics is investigated at this pH at various ionic strengths and a reaction without composition drift up to 80% conversion was achieved. All the chains produced in this reaction contain 30% \u00b1 3% acrylic acid. Copolymer conversions, molecular weights, and composition distributions were measured through Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization (ACOMP) system. The copolymerization data were analyzed by a recent error in variables method (EVM) and reactivity ratios are calculated. The results show that in salt free conditions, the reactivity ratios depend on the ionic monomer concentration (ionic strength) in addition to the pH of the reaction medium. The effect of polyelectrolytic interactions on the reactivity ratios and the resulting composition drift during the reaction, sequence length distribution, and Stockmayer bivariate distribution are discussed in detail. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We found that the acrylic acid fraction in the copolymer was larger when copolymerized in a non\u2010hydrogen\u2010bonding medium and that the methyl methacrylate fraction was larger when copolymerized in a hydrogen\u2010bonding medium. The precise reactivity ratios were reported when toluene, benzene, isopentyl, acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl formate, and <jats:italic>tert</jats:italic>\u2010butyl alcohol were used as the polymerization medium. The values were obtained by chromatographic analysis of residual monomer, followed by computation based on the nonlinear, least\u2010squares technique of Tidwell and Mortimer.</jats:p>",

All reactions presented pseudolinear kinetics. The effect of the monomer feed ratio on the copolymerization kinetics was examined. The conversion level decreased when the proportion of ethyl \u03b1\u2010hydroxymethylacrylate in the monomer feed was larger. Kinetic studies indicated that the radical polymerizations proceeded with apparent living character according to experiments, demonstrating an increase in the molar mass with the monomer conversion and a relatively narrow molar mass distribution. All copolymers were statistical in chain structure, as confirmed by determinations of the monomer reactivity ratios. The monomer reactivity ratios were determined, and the Mayo\u2013Lewis terminal model provided excellent predictions for the variations of the intermolecular structure over the entire conversion range. Additionally, the chemical modification of poly(ethyl \u03b1\u2010hydroxymethylacrylate) was carried out to introduce glucose pendant groups into the structure. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effect of solvents on the copolymerization of acrylamide and styrene has been studied. Copolymerization to low conversions were run in a variety of solvents which would affect the acrylamide monomer in different ways, i.e., by hydrogen bonding, by dipole\u2013dipole interaction only, or by a combination of both. The effect upon the acrylamide was measured by the shift in the infrared spectra of the amide carbonyl and N\uf8ffH groups. Essentially, both hydrogen bridging and dipole\u2013dipole interaction affect acrylamide in the same way, as manifested by a shift in the amide carbonyl and NH towards the longer wavelength. From the standpoint of acrylamide\u2013styrene copolymerization, the greater the shift in the NH absorption, the smaller is the amount of acrylamide that is found in the copolymer. Thus, by the proper choice of solvent, it is possible to obtain copolymers from the same monomer feed ranging in combined acrylamide from very low to very high, and reactivity ratios for acrylamide also ranging from very low to very high. Conversely, for styrene, activity ratios will range from high to low.</jats:p>",

From the results, the monomer reactivity ratios and the Alfrey-Price Q, and e values were determined. It was found that the relative reactivities toward the polystyryl radical were not correlated with the ordinary Hammett equation, but a linear relationship was obtained with a modified Hammett equation which contained a term of the resonance contribution by the substituents. Accordingly, it was considered that the reactivities of substituted phenyl methacrylates depend on both polar and resonance effects caused by the substituents.</jats:p>",

The effect was attributed to a change in the polarity of the ethylenic bond in the acrylamide monomer due to hydrogen bonding and/or dipole\u2014dipole interaction, depending on the medium. In view of those findings, it was suggested that absolute values for the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of these two monomers might be obtained only when the acrylamide monomer is unperturbed. Copolymerizations of these monomers at a number of ratios, therefore, were done in benzene, which does not undergo hydrogen bonding and has no dipole moment, at high dilution, when amide\u2014amide interactions between acrylamide molecules should be essentially eliminated.

This was achieved by using azobisisobutyronitrile as the initiator, and dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent. Effect of copolymerization systems on monomer apparent reactivity ratios for copolymer of acrylonitrile with methyl vinyl ketone was studied for contrast. Values of monomer apparent reactivity ratios were calculated by Kelen\u2013Tudos method. It has been found that the apparent reactivity ratios in aqueous suspension polymerization system were similar to those in solution polymerization system at polymerization conversion less than 20%. Beyond 50% of conversion, the changes of monomer apparent reactivity ratios become less prominent. In water\u2010rich reaction medium [(H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O/dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)&gt;80/20), monomer apparent reactivity ratios were approximately equivalent to those in aqueous suspension polymerization system. In DMSO\u2010rich reaction medium (DMSO/H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O &gt; 80/20), apparent reactivity ratios were similar to those in solution polymerization system.

In the case of the suspension polymerization, the MEA/AN ratio in the polymer particles in which polymerization occurs may be higher than that in the total phase.

The resulting statistic poly(TFEMA\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010TBTFMA) copolymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy to assess their compositions. The kinetics of copolymerization enabled one to determine the reactivity ratios of both comonomers according to the methods of Fineman\u2010Ross, Kelen\u2010T\u00fcdos, and extended Kelen\u2010T\u00fcdos. Excellent correlations were found between these methods leading to the following reactivity ratios: <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>TFEMA</jats:sub> = 4.87 \u00b1 1.50 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>TBTFMA</jats:sub> = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 at 74 \u00b0C. These values indicated that the structure of the copolymers was composed of poly(TFEMA) micro\u2010blocks separated by one TBTFMA unit. Both yields and molecular weights (ranging between 1,000 and 12,000 g/mol) increased with the TFEMA content. The thermal stability of these (co)polymers showed that the decomposition temperature at 10% weight loss increased both with TFEMA content and increasing molecular weights of the poly(TFEMA\u2010<jats:italic>co</jats:italic>\u2010TBTFMA) copolymers. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although there is general recognition of the value of the Alfrey\u2010Price relationship, controversy has not abated concerning the theoretical basis for the equations and the accuracy of the monomer reactivity ratios predicted. A heretofore unrecognized possibility for approaching the problem of general monomer reactivity relationships appears to lie in the consideration of terpolymers. The relationship between monomer and terpolymer compositions is given by the equations\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nA more general and yet simplified relationship underlying terpolymers which has not been previously recognized is derived. This relationship is shown to hold for a wide range of monomer types and concentrations. The overall probability of initiating a, c, and b sequences immediately preceded by b, a, and c, respectively, and of undefined terminating units is equal to the probability of terminating a, c, and b sequences with b, a, and c units, respectively, but of undefined initiating units. This relationship of product probabilities is as follows:\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nand is shown to hold for numerous terpolymer and related copolymer systems. It follows that\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\n<jats:disp-formula>\n\n</jats:disp-formula>\nMethods are presented for predicting the behavior of monomers A and C in copolymerization when the behaviors of A\u2010B and B\u2010C are known. Furthermore, it is shown that the value of eq. (3) is frequently in the range of 0.02\u20130.06. This result is probably related to the fact that terpolymerization of monomers of equal reactivity in equimolar concentrations will yield product probabilities equal to 0.037. Variations in individual probabilities require compensating changes in the other related probabilities.

To know their reactivity in radical copolymerization reactions with methyl methacrylate (MMA), a model monomer (MTm) was synthesized to determine the reactivity ratios and compare them with the low molar fractions of copolymers of MT with MMA because they were difficult to isolate. They were <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MTm</jats:sub> = 0.97 and <jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sub>MMA</jats:sub> = 0.95. The compositional diagrams when representing the weight fraction of MT and MTm in the feed and the copolymer suggested that a clear correlation exists between the experimental points of the model monomer MTm and the macromonomer MT ones, suggesting that the length of the side poly(ethylene oxide) chain does not affect the reactivity of the methacrylic double bond in the prepared monomers for this type of polymerization reaction. The reactivity ratios of the copolymers have a tendency for the formation of random or Bernoullian copolymers.
